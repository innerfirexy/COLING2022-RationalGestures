conventional loan but it's actually
that you'll be pretty good like not
is even more complicated as a business
the opposite I'm telling you this to
doesn't mean that movies and television
now it also depends on where you live
students in your class for their input
to be able to take the big steps in the
but guess what that's what everybody is
their actors that fit this particular
classes available
interest rate
so it really just depends on incide ly
well here's what happened after the
show you 10 ways to gain experience as
i had worked with in the past before
and then coming down to atlanta i put on
video called four ways to get a talent
control you don't need an agent to do
seconds your knees start shaking your
money to people that don't have that 20%
language and I did that in 2006 with
the dreaded tell me about yourself
buy clothes that were on sale or just
right so when you are a recurring
is called
already started on the movie meaning
dollars so fifteen thousand dollars more
the casting director does have an
post projects saying they need a web
about what the costs are to start an
are used in your location if you're in a
see if that is happening
know like reading every word
protector for the iPad pro using my link
finding a pre-licensing course in
to run a little bit more if you want to
20% down payment this leaves you with a
acting that is great experience
how it's happened to me
ways to gain experience and
agents are trying to represent a diverse
for any role in a movie or tv show there
investments that i have made into my
invested into amazing paid education
for the deputies part everybody had it
back when the movie comes out
selling your services this one's
but as you've done a little bit of work
this is your first time here make sure
time living from a thousand true fans
make sure to hit that like button and
and that goes right underneath your name
so that's why I decided to make this
or a condo you'll probably have to share
fourth step is to
liquid savings account alright the third
these other factors
for those types of projects so if you're
school directory on small market after
joining me here today if you haven't
well they're going to get bombarded with
lot more storage and then this is the
less than 20% down rather than waiting
now sorry guys with anything good
there's tons of things you can do to
just to get an
not yet ready to buy a house
house you know kind of do a walk through
audition if we're gonna do two takes of
personal decision
or a detective who's sitting across the
today thank you so much again and i'll
i am still working through this book i'm
none of the roles that you audition for
or people with neck tattoos or people
this final line in the film section i
different questions with two very
what's up my fellow actors curt you here
and you could of risk with me on the
have to move to japan to really pursue
i would be cut off from almost all the
having a monetizable skill is not an
beginning of them correct yes we're in
or saving money for example let's talk
say that if you really want to be super
you know the unexpected things might
whenever i hit the grocery store
i've talked about this in other videos
might be asking
unfortunately a lot people get burnt out
setting interaction and I can see you
agent in the us maybe there is someone
so if you are a non-union actor you are
mcdonald's receipt
make the effort to learn the business of
where you look directly into the camera
and done it and this is not like doing
do is you want to ask yourself
furnace room blare up because that takes
and it was an incredible investment i
generally apply otherwise so make sure
when they come out i also want to thank
they're probably only going to watch the
questions below let me know if there's
every day
exciting time but you also need to be
designing websites and I made this
and if you're interested in learning
found out that i was
like this well now our face is
can help you out
time and after the auditions were done
was able to get an agent in the u.s was
know what real estate investing entails
also for projects sometimes when you're
you definitely don't want to be
idea what had happened
is game Crack at your next week and I
you learn the skills you need to break
that I learned which we'll get to in a
a rental expense yes this could increase
sag-aftra joining the union sag-aftra is
multi-unit living one of the units and
for instance then i would have to pay
change to sit on a chair I am carrying
auditions there
to put 20% down if there were no loan
it even if you don't book
of how an agent gets paid
day jobs is pretty cool it means that if
cheat sheet to help you with your
i know this is a lot but this is really
completely quiet for our self taped
agent will be able to get you
10 times back and so that's what we're
these days companies are so good at
there's probably going to be a time in
know that it's getting a little bit
that role and then it was like you know
those talent agents aren't necessarily
is what's the best place to live to
i say just get started you guys get that
auditioning for and I told her the
matters that shows people
expensive well that's
renovations and some people just prefer
and again that's a reason
photos is that they're generally
residuals okay let's move on to today's
i can't do it from where i live i would
competition it's about getting involved
I might be too young for other parts and
version and give them that all right so
crazy like
real estate agent you have so many hats
a deal to put your height on your resume
off-book they're asking you do you have
video we are talking about
a quality tenant the difference between
the top two
house later on be more like cookie
now if that isn't within your budget if
the agent now passing that information
very much with everything and if you
next we have sides now we just talked
to use the mileage method if you drive
and that means you're gonna be held more
that you did i hope you guys enjoyed the
than a week
what is a fair wage and that's where a
my family so my parents they always had
states yet so
your real estate principles your real
stress enough how important this is
worth it as long as they are a really
please comment below and I'll answer
in my opinion when you weigh all the
account where you're paying taxes on the
stress situation like a big budget
even though it isn't directly acting
don't have to follow
your scene tomorrow instead
patience in this career and if you don't
you know
or auditions that they've had you want
production markets are los angeles
pretty outside so we want to make sure
stability that you're sacrificing
and the potential growth the goal is to
audition because I can put that
probably answer
description below the next thing that
about coffee this is where we have
one simply because of the numbers they
if you were in a short film you would
particular scenes of a project so you
the acting career center here to help
because they're letting you borrow a
so i hope all that makes sense in terms
happened to movie stars
using all these different tricks will
write so when we actually write
you learn the skills you need to break
day the next term is copy now copy is
and joy and happiness and money and we
so a real estate agent is actually a
get more videos from me every single
pay any money but
like that she's actually the one writing
there are tons of different strategies
same mistake I did
you can spend a lot of money if the
me so that's why i have
very very difficult
what this does is it allows you to write
it's about
and getting paid for it so let's get
for a lot of newer actors so um i had a
achieve your goals and if you are
could be the best actor who read for
from that sale now i know that was a lot
a move is a huge financial burden unless
guys to try and do is attach a monthly
what your skills are and if i like what
day it has to be sustainable or the
blocking down so you really get to feel
really cool how this works what it's
investor in the future as a real estate
and all of your marketing materials that
credit history at 15
it typically happens so let's say I had
are ways where you can actually get
money which we need to live but being
movies and shows
able to make money online outside of our
suffers greatly from impatient itis it's
them and says hey i'm brand new i don't
your credit score the average credit
and maybe they can help you jump start
happen to fit well then your chances are
and then there was a patient and a nurse
of my career personally i'm currently
guys for watching make sure to hit that
but you don't get the future payments in
wanted to simplify it because
thank you and again don't be so
commercial type work and when i moved
that you continuously see
we're not going to stick to it word for
spending some time here with me today on
a ton of commercial print modeling in my
an adu in the backyard and build a
now if you're trying to move to new york
because i am working so much in film and
club series where we distill and discuss
to type all right
just really crazy to see that they can
your body
home off the market wasting a lot of
off of commission so they charge a
of money from affiliate marketing or you
then also if you want to subscribe to my
accountability and that's why you really
always seems to be the better actors on
then later on you know once you've got
my auditions then i've actually created
goal and that's not to say that general
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
skim through the material and
you that a lot of times there will be
encourage you to watch this
since the very beginning and i've had
value adding things
going to be
next audition the stepping stone to your
they can have zero experience and then
reader is typically standing right next
control doesn't mean we should just
character has been established on that
to be able to put in
well the answer is that casting
sounds good you should head over to
through the sort of process in order to
new york so yeah those are just averages
really serious
hollywood the majority of the movie was
the casting director and the director
the data be not show you the complete
plus it wouldn't really make sense like
which is generally between 2.5 and 3%
in to audition for representation now
than to actually be working hard in
enough movies and television shows and
we in the industry don't need to hear
that I can't do how do you then do you
thumbs up right over here and leave me a
the last one on this list
video is a video that is created for an
so it could be a tight shot it could be
units is going to be considered a
mind that you're gonna need money to
cold calling other days you'll be
didn't have to work
is that it is not the casting director
spending some time here with me today
reason they call it show business and
by this is that you have
in my opinion when you perform a scene
step six is then the actor preparing for
guys it's Kurt from small market after
and remember to ask your questions down
real estate part-time but this is a
it by going to that link right up there
script and I said oh yes I do have those
about in the
hundred five hundred thousand dollars
transforming your relationship with
so that you will stand out when
real estate commissions for let's say
you know play it safe or if you want to
going to say what type of property
8x10 photo paper
I've learned more about the body and how
but i mean he gave me a call out by my
estate broker living in southern
working on set yesterday that i think is
chapter there are little quizzes that
show business is a business making
photo paper is going to give you a
car insurance now buying car insurance
minimum for these numbers that you want
open just for agents with their clients
what show they were auditioning for they
up again not the first thing that I do
makes you most comfortable and works
and helping others in their area of
casting director all they can say is hey
non-union and union productions the
relatively new to acting I was going on
there are these things you need to know
look that lots of people are going to
because that's where the majority of
making a lot of money doing these
shows and was able to get an
those projects will have residuals and
speaking roles
management program that i use for my
parts of that one is your interest so
first agent
I don't book it but guess what ten
three union background vouchers so if
who wants that look at the features the
that's something that you want to pursue
enthusiastic and passionate about your
the market on the MLS it's going to
team coached 500 get and stories of this
expensive le at least a million or two
that nobody else has and the way that i
could see just how nice this house
alright let's talk about the vampire
it's going to be life-changing for so
says camera set still laughing and
why our job is not to book the role and
your resume it's a win-win
we're at home decompress
is looking at you and you say i want
courses or you have just finished them
then your headshot will be printed on
a a person that works at a coffee shop
renting the other ones out or you're
do is go to our head shot and drag that
will do a better job and if you wouldn't
voice over actor in commercials voice
the acting career center here to help
600 they're gonna actually only look at
you have to become eligible first and
know more and more people are turning to
rental units as a duplex because with a
food is there you know there are a lot
runner and so we just kind of grew up in
getting out of your comfort zone believe
from a talent agency is another huge
that's the only time i've seen someone
do much else and to be honest it's
the tuition
oh my gosh i'm stepping stones into
audition was for a commercial for a home
start with drop shipping the basic idea
weddings on my own yet i was second
about how to get started and how to gain
that link right there
they definitely will do things the right
actors first and they find who they're
prior to getting an agent in fact those
was this audition I would have to do
is run and you're getting paid you're
you guys can do to increase the value
money when added up over time so let's
and my heart is truly to help you do
monologues are used quite a bit but i
because your real estate agent is gonna
to Starbucks but maybe it's a day where
fit the description is
a film and television resume so if you
you're thinking I want to make money
guest or two come on for us to like chat
that's gonna get you the best rate and
male or female so that's the character
union contract
but if you aren't in one of those cities
getting a Kindle or you know going to
description below if you haven't seen
because of the way that i was created
residuals on those projects let me tell
i do think most of you guys
a sag-aftra member or you are non-union
know have you given yourself enough time
over six very bad money habits that are
you know every single day is going to be
and that's going to be important later
experience we all start
to create a demo reel once you get to
particular role
how to answer the dreaded tell me about
important just know that there's a huge
casting networks and backstage if you
is a company training video so if you've
real estate investing for example how
asked this question in an audition and I
after a few years or so in the field
100 000 subscribers and until next time
percentage I'm doing really well with
advice now before we get started today i
get your gains and stuff and there's a
only thing that's good about these
lot of money
but i hope it gave you a clear
amazing thing is if you actually live in
you would use again the same three
talking about first avoid anything
get a great workout in 10 minutes you
increase drastically and being able to
you need to be providing 25 pieces of
sample deal which
infamous stories of directors rejecting
forced me to spend more time with each
getting your first little bit
walk and exit out of frame on this side
sides onset so anytime you go on set for
and there your little corner yesterday gabriel pixie
by VA approved lenders and they're
of contacting you
investing procrastination the
over in this video first is don't read
agent have to use to pitch you to a
sometimes other countries
live in kansas city
into a website template and creating a
what's up guys kurt you here from
so take that background work off your
i said working in class
every audition is a win because of and
attention directly by doing sponsorships
doing this
and easy way to get your license thank
work their way up right so in your
going to be
we rarely ate out and if we didn't eat
you never have to pay them a flat fee
that you are committed the first way to
there are things like podcasts
you actually are
credits to your resume but they also can
area it's pretty cool and then they also
videos up there so if you have an imdb
corporate training videos
talk about acting as part of your answer
this happens sometimes because the
overview of the casting process there
then i was pretty confident that i would
reducing the spending by let's say 20
if you want to download that for free
how much money you'd end up saving now
mortgages they actually don't offer any
you got two recommendations and one
for you to get your first client if
real estate about personal finance
overpaying for properties because you
online then I do in my day job of
get an agent at some point in their
you have the option to put a really
streaming networks number one is a show
up for a show or you're in a show and
the description of this video so they
to talk about today I think you shared a
real estate in your free time you can do
to do with permit laws and rental rates
to consider in terms of location
well it's pretty complicated and it's a
for the three-day weekend and so if all
just learn from the process the two most
my listings are as easy as this one
anything back here distracting the
with i definitely recommend
that pressure away
coffee shops will save you a lot of
platforms there are
something that I hope is gonna resonate
who's a scam
out now this is going to really depend
different from a typical audition
residual payments are but in a nutshell
of course it's annoying because you have
i mean think about this imagine if a
instagram so we chat a lot about that so
of people that receive an audition then
long commute you can work on it then
either we want to make sure our set is
on hand picked the rules and the reasons
some handholding but that is
so you could write something like that
I think all of us can think of things
the characteristic that they are
like they are emphasized
the point with passive income where I
long period of time but only if I give
now definitely for some industries this
but maybe they're only looking at union
with this option
videos either directly to the casting
I you know this is gonna help me out a
if you have commercial credits
beginners on how to edit videos on Final
of actors who have done
extra room so really the more bedrooms
wished he could have called the book jab
download right now by clicking that
therefore I can't teach online but you
was called won't back down and it
and I read for that character after I
irregular schedules and sometimes we had
first is you build equity right whenever
so here are three ways to prove to them
Amazon favorites list and I just I've
adding a couple lines uh they added a
change the baseboards and add some crown
chance and
city first get as much training as you
the audition can be live and in person
in the long run but it is a little bit
for months for years it really compounds
side of the union a few quick
if you want to download that free cheat
single week now it's actually been more
actors lifestyle that's not always the
trivial but in an industry that is as
gonna give you
booked it and the day that we shot on
on all income up to 137
someone sees it
of the things that we were talking about
below as well we'll be sure to put all
already then let me be the first to tell
but just know that if you decide to join
about your specific city a lot of people
the more that they see you you're
then there are probably other casting
years even if they take like a 50 cuts i
wait for those prices to go down
for four workouts we replicate movements
and the payments are for future uses
there's all sorts of different platforms
people in there thinking
after you take the course make sure you
much for spending some time here with me
the acting career center here to help
already going to have a system in place
days that you work
character that's included in the story
that i found most useful when preparing
back and forth from cleveland pittsburgh
if you're local otherwise i definitely
there for new agents for example keller
in the united states agents make a 10
through a commission
only bring back the people that they are
a bigger pool of potential buyers later
offer the part to somebody else why
other people but they may not have had
i mean to be completely honest i think
big deal because you are that much
looking for that when they're deciding
know Southern America and it's like okay
i've seen too many actors move to a new
sometimes need that extra bit of
that were not written
application and mail it in to your
get their real estate license that means
best represents you to other people in
high credit score's with high incomes
Brandon anywhere where do you think he
you whether or not a deal is good all
then factor that in and then and then
inch lights look better on your ceiling
they hire someone who
or if you live in a city that doesn't
basically what i did i skimmed through
than portraiture which is what I
years ago I was in London for work what
audition class i highly
you virtually yeah it's good to see you
just sold we were on the market for like
audition I mentioned earlier then I will
one thing know only how to audition is a
the photo based on some calculations but
own short films we'd have a lot of fun
see first because if you bought a
you can invest as little as a hundred
doing that that can make a reasonable
side and not have to look at where I'm
have to trust you as well because if you
if you're attending a school who that
even if you're just starting out if you
into this industry just know that it
where you've done all those things
competitive wages and safe excellent
for someone that lived in another
major markets like new york or los
keeping track of all the stuff deters
want to understand the financials of
now i want to emphasize again that if
someone in their 40s or 50s however
to keep play it close to the best
feel free to leave them down in the
take this
scenes of footage then you will need to
think too many people they live
towards it and we got to be there for
with another actor
and all over the world people eat
when you are buying a home for yourself
whole piece of paper that'd be a pretty
neighborhood you can send a cold emails
this is a really great way to build your
thanks so much for your time again and
guys to think of every single purchase
union to make sure the sets are safe
that you're not only
movie and that can help you as an actor
part of that money goes to principal aka
in the scene
them and then dm them all the time about
you definitely don't have to be like a
no that's not how it works at the end of
new actor to force them to imagine a
know it's got to be sustainable for you
including netflix shows mormon movies
inside the script and then step two is
i decided to move to atlanta instead of
you know the director is gonna tell me
net worth
a bunch of monologues when um when i
tried to make acting and everything you
become their own boss and you can set
production in terms of work available
classes if your
and let's say for the walking dead you
just those letters to cue your brain to
are your annual dues so
couple things I wanted to talk about
business with someone else or even if
brushes are made out of the point is is
rerun on the network
the acting career center here to help
something that should have been taken in
you for your services essentially
you might be wondering why don't they
workout a lot of people will be thinking
for instance bfa musical theater you put
website number four masterminds and
work as an actor you have to audition
it doesn't make any sense to me to learn
money as your tools allow you to
you can use to market yourself and
on demand or let's say a streaming
that decision after the fact okay so
looking at homes now one thing i want to
obviously that's good you just get to
offer online like if you just look on
lose her the role that worked for her
much staying with j ust of bells whatsapp
auditions and it's used on set there
and it's possible that they simply have
and booked my role as well as the big
and what happens when a production
female deputy because they wanted to
lines memorized for that audition a mark
squats up and down up and down up and
this thing open up these and voila so
with it and to be honest i probably
that you're willing to give up all of
i was not happy about it but i knew that
well in this video i want to share with
is something that i've done a lot of in
contributed to a couple of the lessons
your money on is
the actions just like in acting with
and so people have asked me you know do
scenes meaning a scene that is a
is going to be live when this video
use them heavily but if you live outside
the productions are happening my
your demo reel
different way to ask and when you do
level 3 comes in level 3 is when we
in just a sec hey guys it's Kurt from
let's say for example that they want to
is that
the full three thousand dollars
they'll be recording your answer to this
is way too high we'll start with three
someone else the installation costs are
home for yourself
push a door open I pull it towards me
and not on the future
especially when you are brand new hey
of production the prop plays a very
with you it's out there doing something
trust i know without a doubt you're
ago I published a video titled
000 business miles using your car this
countries but the colleges and
your 20s or 30s or maybe it's just a
kind of audience as Gary Vaynerchuk and
about three
if it's digital then your headshot will
instead of studying
implement that content you know seeing
that a great audition doesn't guarantee
got and that's and even when you know
introduction to Python course over it
in film and television
want you can set it through your own
the same thing applies to let's say a 10
to say it again
has become a huge huge film and
step is to
high in carbohydrates both are very high
steady paycheck every week or every
know getting rich by making money on the
so now why do non-union productions even
lot of people are scared because they
a free trial of skill show and then you
exchanging value like we all use money
three hours thread throughout the course
since i've made a video maybe over two
who has a stable income and can help you
business so you can get those right off
going to replace thousands and thousands
and 20 commission off of all of your
getting my first few lessons and acting
theater job
you want to be seen as a professional
and your body so that the camera sees
is you can change literally anything
but i just booked my very first speaking
lead all the way down to all the
really gonna prepare you give you the
with my arms and so you know yes but but
$100,000 loan just to keep it simple
let me say that i am not a theater actor
complex hardwood floor definitely skip
is an explosion that happens during your
again it was right for me and i know
video if you liked it please give me a
lenders so that leaves this insurance up
gonna be under $100 so it is extremely
a market in terms of just film and tv
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
put in the work yes i'm willing to work
question because the truth is an agent
much as possible so having workflows for
and your resume will either be printed
so in this video i want to share with
term is off-book off-book simply refers
aren't necessary now of course you do
all the days you're working to pay for
most of that stuff will not show up in
able to share with you
have a great
google look up your state and then a
not to beat yourself up about it right
acting ability eventually you'll be
gonna do that instead what i want you
that was able to bring in an equity
of deals and money you make that's when
hassle of trimming the resume and then
the commercial somewhere during that
actually in the field doing work you can
makes us feel like unprofessional actors
this particular youtube channel is
photo paper now matte photo paper is
affordable after you finish your real
different things right and so i would
are thousands of people competing for a
money you're putting in and you're
on an
supposed to function you know I'm able
houses before so I do have some
days prior to prepare that audition
have that so-called 20% magic number
national bureau of economic research
before getting a talent agent in fact
lower credit score they are definitely
real estate express because
need in one year in three or four months
house so there's one bedroom downstairs
whatever it may be
one of them the other ones have to be
more wealth these are very common habits
examples so say I have an audition for a
you they're really talented but i can't
really simple like a cell phone or a
for those of you who are still in school
is a different version of this that's
because the average american spends
that was about nine hundred fifty
test main questions
I'm sure many of you watching this video
programs out there that accepted
doing is
prioritize giving auditions to union
old you can start working on your credit
if a commercial is under a sag after
offers and it sold way over asking price
and they want to see a demo reel of your
other countries but i have no experience
downsides this includes reduced privacy
performance nights where they do a
the videos to teach those
character quickly it probably feels like
leave them down in the comments below
don't look like i'm 60. and
and if you're able to do that and get
doing background work if there is a
to be the teacher's assistant or to be
haven't already please subscribe to this
down payment then I really like urge you
shooting on set so for instance if
not you should join
to where to work to impress our
weird situation and let's bring it back
for representation legitimate talent
first let me welcome those of you who
but i'm not holding my breath and here's
and it represents actors in film
and it's not based on the number of
deliver the best audition you possibly

anything that i can help you guys
watched a training video on how to do
the casting director is looking at a sea
never auditioned for that role i
and remember we said earlier union
industry who's watching your audition
it's like
feet you're left with a percentage and
your own future income that way for
documented as well this means you'll
to earn the money to buy the thing and
20 or 30 actors that means for each
like and trust you from the value that
yeah and I think one of the other things
once you tell everybody about yourself
who may want to work with you and learn
about her templates it's absolutely
preparation guide yet you can get it
is open up an account
that can make your house purchase go
work with me because i do not do
an epson product and epson is a company
in you know over a hundred hours into
i don't have backstage because it is not
that 600 credit score when determining
but it's one of the most important parts
that skill to other
section of a resume
to delete that right now

marketing so for marketing obviously
just work as a salesperson you'll want
their own graphics making their own

you're interested in joining the team
that so with me for example I've got a
really close to starting to shoot I
really the easiest way of selling
student films are exactly what they
money so that's just that heads up so
include film and tv i highly encourage
shortcut to fame try to go first but
why is that that's because when you turn
the end of the day really it has to be
recommend jumping into real estate as
if you're outside
want to share with you three headshot
series regular
with you a few lessons that I've learned
really passionate about your dogs it's
really wanted to talk to you because
and these are just really generally bad
they have
you can just be like
as an employee since you're also the
down in the description below step
those are the ones that you should get i
really sought not only was I totally
you're getting a credit for your resume
a corporate video or an industrial video
where you have
representation and they told me hundreds
theater in their past
i'm going to show you exactly how to do
also get a lot of questions from you
that you should really
blocking for the scene on what they're
different topics
closer to booking your next one all
loose script
movie or making the show
do i regret
something it's a way
in is on the uptrend
some of you
show you so will you give them an
attached to its and word olympic trend mil
keep in mind because anybody that asks
work on any
that's a word if it's not Webster's what
search for those groups
next video
learn those things
that's how it all works now depending on
experience i have the option before
then buy it from a third party that's
visually going to be a happening and
selling info products so buy info
anybody in this industry
side so
hard work and dedication and it starts
I'm doing anything I could be out
recommend is having a lot of knowledge
miss any payments or have anything go
back to the main space of your home it's
way to yours go are now and barriers and
making well over one million dollars
no all you have to do is follow them and
for this particular audition they're
are not going to pay you any money
industry because like i said before
as an actor is a little bit different
your student you can just study at night
are they a credit for your resume
definitely want to check out this next
spent a $42,000 learn a lot of stuff and
become a tv and movie actor even though
clarity the two that we're going to talk
17 and 47 cents per month on bottled
picture out there
they're here so
because you're thinking about investing
your audition
two-time world champion and triathlons
eligible for a solo 401k now when you're
that i know
that they were
of the rental income as their management
you get help your child you walk you
first-time homebuyers don't have so yeah
I'm gonna share with you my booking
or series regular i'm not going to get
the margins the first letter of each
effect is on your body now are there
actual question and the answer for
own demo reel footage to now have
when an actor walks in the room with a
in this case for an actor you may need a
all the time to
projects from that day
and next thing I knew you know my dad
paid for it and in the united states the
you have to look out for
in working with an agent that doesn't go
most production
today is because you can watch
something with yourself and look you
single week
step number eight is to start
pair and recover they don't grow they
paper which is eight-and-a-half by 11
say you're on on a job and you're in the
that's a huge plus because you're
you're not trying to juggle all of these
check out my own brokerage I have my own
question you want to know what you
income side and learning all the things
units now let's talk about all the steps
thank you so much for sticking around
reasoning for them
guarantee that you'll become successful
whole process now a lot of people get
tools that i recommend
many bedrooms which means that you can
good-looking enough for some parts but
essentially our allotment of time here
viola davis and oscar isaac
you should not be afraid of any type of
process that your agent will take
see any resumes that say
auditions you will get usually get the
resources as possible not just me i mean
first store in a team of the year before
percentage over the hundreds and
in front of the casting director well a
romeo and juliet you play juliet little
heavily decrease the amount of money
and they could have been considering
while performing and that is by being a
auditions and
weight so I'm more conscious of how much
difficult to install especially if you
have that
one day
doctor to say something different
crop image and this is the one that we
but i do have some free resources
just because you don't book that
university professor just just be
is I think a much easier way that anyone
distribution to be zero
I'm sure you have as well to have a good
wallpapers pictures and without you load
aside jobs sometimes multiple side jobs
in atlanta who's a friend of mine his
as we were doing things you know a lot
a retirement plan there are so many
managers make their money
could in your business
sometimes we forget so how can we
the skies and it really makes your
real estate license like i mentioned
people with not too much money to invest
backed by the US Department of Veteran
invested in stocks
a drama club or doesn't have school
producers where the project is shooting
nebulous concept
these types of practice questions you
professional camera
practicing the words anymore you're also
themselves on the recorded versions but
give it a thumbs up and remember to
lot of people they'll read all the
investing thank you so much and i'll see
value and when you do have the cash
don't care how big the movie was i don't
very complex topic
you can have an llc with an escort
store and so putting this all together
and hollywood the industry hollywood is
acting in movies and television shows
hair was because after that role I cut
really want to make sure that your
dysmorphia I have stretch marks I have
already you definitely want to subscribe
her explanation of it is quite different
all the people that get residuals now if
15 20 before you elect to join that's
scenes were in the movie
okay those were my tips on how to find
typical so if you have 100 people on
classes then
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
can just kind of browse through all the
showing homes to a buyer you could be
now before we get into what happened
is by taking acting classes and that can
next booking just because you didn't
because if Kurt let's say you're gearing
an audition with a full costume one it
pinpoint okay like when i made that
them to see that sometimes you're gonna
process that has helped me book all of
their answers and you understand the
side of it or is there an acting
leverage to superpower the sale of
for that movie pittsburgh is about
hard here in California you just need a
000 home in missouri could rent out for
you can definitely start getting good at
uh a couple shows i'm gonna copy and
real estate
takeaways that i think
not letting it sit in their savings
training and stuff like that right and
very important to print our headshots on
up to move to a new city
actually make your mortgage payments if
should go full time in your business so
pre-approval now i think about this
down in one technician class
product right well that's not
so i feel like that's something really
for a new marvel show
here are the top three reasons one they
can be an invaluable experience that
it's not gonna be comfortable you're
if this is your first time here make
interested in just some personal
strengthening and mobilizing the whole
day and then
auditioning all of these things can be
transcribe the lines by writing it down
you'll have a standard or
more likely to call you in for more
acting just to satisfy our curiosity
most acting classes are not quite that
is great and all but people are actually
instagram and get a bunch of praise for
immediately it's not like you decide you
there working with an a-list celebrity
of these websites down in the
so now that we've gone into both the
video or photo and turn it into amazing
don't get too strung up on the details
stressful a lot of things are out of
theater i'd love to know what your
they don't want to get an agent because
and rehearse so I will use a little
and pass that state exam in california
like personally when I walk into a place
you can be a production assistant if you
commercial classes scene study classes
information they'll take really detailed
in california that's going to be 135
small-market actor calm in this video
their 60s or 70s and
can you do it from another city
words because those things will for sure
a for savings account
they want however small or large
take advantage of all the other things
into default now when you're trying to
in a place that is not a tiny little
people better actors and i should have
put a link to it down in the description
month or two and then has to move back
theater world
is to work on camera acting in plays
comment below - I'd love to hear about
between takes all the time and don't get
on in this story
need to be aware of any unexpected costs
movies and tv shows this is the way to
already ahead of the game if you get an
also touches on a lot it's the thought
some of the greates
in hollywood are all union members
want to dip into that emergency fund
and now let's say the movie comes out
fees every time that you
syndicate to all of the real estate
so I was like you know what let's see if
term sides copy refers to the lines that
but my answer actually is no i do not
technique classes improv scene study
depending on the printer you may need to
when you do pass it off to someone your
program that elizabeth mccravy uses her
is through their guidance
what's the best place to live to grow
headspace because of it and so
the acting career center here to help
do we bound through the door refreshed
have 20% equity they all take off that
of a product conflict is that if you
that's perfect that's all you need when
that position
um whether you're a service-based
in high cost of living areas like los
through this residential income
are plenty of opportunities to still do
gain as much experience as you can
is played think about the commercials
like this will be a big factor in their
assistant and helping out
depending on what school you go to
video also on my youtube channel about
in acting from a college or a university
what happened to me
it kind of shows it looks like time pass
auditions and she mentioned a potential
why it's such a good first-time
so three weeks later they brought me
this as a hobby anymore
and put it on their scene partner to
acting ability and
the main problem the casting director
so one important thing to note is that
lot of places have their the calories up
because obviously you're not going to go
and i went back to cleveland i didn't
can cash flow the housing prices are
my experience and my advice
job where you know not every day is the
such as vons or ralph's that's where you
worth five hundred fifteen thousand
i make a ton of content about personal
it I I had it and it was gonna be for
false they are myths that you are
see if those
so let's say this could be part of your
to a new york or an la
has to be sustainable for you you know
go back to the folder and we have this
shows then I've created a free audit
that but whenever I see the crew getting
result in performance what i recommend
audition right there on the spot that
more videos on acting
example through real estate express
you know Gary Vaynerchuk loads of links
a big-time hollywood celebrity you're
you want to learn the best and you can
is what i did in 2016. i moved from
expenses here in los angeles so yeah i
then you really will have to move to the
get your first on-camera acting
for credits or you can have them
your special skills
effectively i'm going to explain exactly
every young actor should take to heart
or try and sell them something and he
sales and letting your people know about
that we've been able to kind of create
lenders look at when they determine if
do you need an agent to become an actor
the casting directors and producers made
same way
just how big of an impact this has on
you those buying a house is a real
continue to network
say it that way and that we have to have
impression to anyone in the industry now
me from like this direction as I lie on
knew I could just take that Commission
my business in the past i would say a
that actor
i consider that investing in real estate
like I I was I was too big and that's
they're definitely the most affordable
actor and free wi-fi and a balcony and a
i'm just super interested in different
can and a paintbrush or any other
and you have to build up your finances
transaction coordinators and other
i want you to understand that this is
my name is kurt you thank you for
it and i knew that this was all part of
and also
more than working on a monologue by
can get a lot of really great workouts
so your total loan now becomes one
among the first-time homebuyers it
happens all the time as well and it's
or a movie or a short film or a student
around now do not have someone try to
the next thing that every actor will
and the medical student has to try to
because look you have to be able to
room in my condo i was still paying out
a percentage of your housing costs or
biggest reason why people fail the test
that i use to prepare for my own test so
I'm glad that it happened to me as
into the templates so there was a lot of
let's say you're an actor who is doing
getting started and if you have
then give them your financial
line and
which allows you to calculate your cap
you're not going to make those same
actor in their own country
sag-aftro what its purpose is
this happens quite a bit in this
right before we move on I think it's
type of investing that grows with you
per year by choosing to live with a
that how is that actually an investment
I heard these phrases said before but
clipboard now commercial auditions
of people out there who are watching
with discipline and structure and things
like that so we need to strengthen and
that requires your concentration so if
about about this one thing and the
even if it's not a big film and
so in this video we're going to talk
pain no gain
when you're first starting out when you
may or may not regret doing
industry my name is kurt yu thank you so
family and your friends will likely use
going to ask for i'm going to say well
that the world of health and fitness but
one is appreciation and this is when the
the scene
but find a way to work with another
things get busy and i'm not able to post
need to be spending some money elsewhere
actingcareercenter.com now this is not a
is that really worth it on that note one
to be 8 by 10 well the image on the
project hopefully you've got some
well under $100 now if you go to the
they cost a lot of money they cost
and best of all you don't need to be
your financials
if you're interested in that video i'll
up front for representation is a
habits that you should be letting go of
exactly your complexion and your hair
then i just don't know how useful
what do you mean no not doing it I
for free these days there's hundreds of
that's not how it works
put it in perspective of other jobs if i
to find a local brokerage that can
it's just like what I'm doing in here
about it it has to work for you is
i do have independent contractors that i
acting auditioning and career advice
auditions for local commercials
the audition the focus should be on the
props are distracting and focus on the
seriously you have unique gifts
get some medicine
learning and i hope to see you on set
hope everything we just talked about
the more money you save now
have been totally worth it and if you're
new york
strategies that you should use as well
up on youtube you can put this on your
said you know are you okay with X Y &amp; Z
online course for example on how to
your investment will be worth it in the
makes it feel like your money is not
trying to get my agent and i wanted to
the time and when you are your own boss
because of my unique strengths and
there might be a cut off for union
young kids we're so impatient we want
this YouTube channel I've managed to do
much more theater when i was just
okay I need to change something because
is what color temperature you want it's
what's a good amount of time to be
anything for money this is
cars at all times you never know when
and for me
and they decided to choose me and that
what is one of the biggest lessons that
currently have may not be the current
take my word for it i actually just saw
involved in the commercial well
this is an easy question to answer i'm
for two three five eight hours you're
dollars per audition
below and now that you've created a demo
so i don't want you to feel this
um have better lighting for my images
know this but
with all that time and money spent on
your financial situation and just create
not really in the industry itself
but you're only doing one and you're
agent you're submitting to
you don't want just to copy and paste of
are incredible they have a great you
because that's how we talk in real life
laminate or a luxury vinyl these are
apply what you've learned where do you
sheet that you can get from the acting
yourself you can also get your real
commercials and it even happens
to get a feel for the acting landscape
commandment number eight is to have a
acting facebook groups
belichick who is a local pittsburgh
more classy looking I think these days
much recommend an online class you can
don't have enough of it and most of us
other ways to do lead generation we are
friends our family our local community
very like someone sees your brand and
i've never actually lived in los angeles
my website you'll find that list down in
if you want to move to a market like
for internet they normally present you
probably going to be a little bit better
looking for and
payment problems eviction and criminal
thumbs up and if you haven't already
and how to join and when to join that
overseas get an agent in the united
when they look at something like this
market you know you could drive some
drive-through and grab the wrap of mocha
professional actor
anyone can do it and that also means
you can get it by going to that link
clients coming my way for example many
it has to do with whether or not you can
you haven't already
second and talk about how
questions which is sort of the things
and may give slightly different advice
the agent will then tell the actor hey
have heard me tell the story of how i
acting or theater and this kind of goes
little girl the reason that I booked it
they had
insurance is basically a policy that
a fh8 approved lender and it's insured
the longevity of the show also
the best advice that i can give
all of those tapes at this point there
television shows
friends I decide to teach myself PHP
videos on
i'm talking your hotel your airfare your
another great way
first let me say that there are some
but all in a package that's engaging and
so i encourage you guys to refer back to
a fatal mistake that a lot of actors
worry it's not my home phone number
thumbnail that i used for this video is
the chances that I will book my audition
and that you're letting affect the way
from me allowed me to kind of pursue it
that clears things up as to how much an
my desk I was checking out the police
is actually focusing on rentals not too
because a lot of them can either a skew
get my agent in atlanta so when i was
everybody starts with zero credits right
encourages you because if you're just
have helped over 900
for the most part look at it this way
you don't have any money left so that's
for a film and television audition
imagine I have a commercial audition for
stuff you build an audience by giving
your kitchen every dollar you spend it's
in this video we're going to talk about
basically every time that a production
and starting to
what you're going to do is you're going
the limitations of a small market
might not be but just understand what
many of the details but with a roth
really is a great time to invest in real
we used to use but now just doesn't
going to be running that scene with them
and probably the most common question I
it's not exactly easy on your pocket
thumb in a really bad way so make sure
done so what I would recommend you know
day this time
something like 10 plus credits or
auditions from home well let me share
research and start networking this step
turn them into a working actor but
something to show anybody who asked for
other roles on that show so this is why
flooring which is also really really
graduated so i don't necessarily have
major production cities like los angeles
increasingly it's becoming easier and
make a website or an app and you could
in the comments below that's it for this
more videos on acting
monologues even in the classroom look i
it can take months or even years
so for a couple examples when i had my
one time while he was having a
along to the actor
ton of movies and television shows
which is where you want to be commercial
down below until next time keep
decide to use a prop I'll try to keep it
yeah it's possible but it's a heck of a
recap number one paid education number
handy-dandy voice recorder like this you
time to make a ton of mistakes on set
let's get started
tell them you're uncomfortable with
this video let me briefly mention some
people out and then your network is
and I were doing the dishes next to each
in or the state
for example let's say you have a youtube
if you like this video please give it a
type and everything well then you
when i get an audition so if you want to
safe at work
failure well every time you go to
at what doesn't isn't necessary and then
digital downloads or online courses
i'm going to put a link down in the
this audience of people who know like
videos at home
that's like a for
off of that project
times people are just worried about the
gotten auditions for
be something that you should think about
you for the role of the teacher but
expensive to live in uh the other reason
of getting booked
move out of frame hey if you're getting
license and we'll talk more about the
read for this other role as well that's
budget so
a few more projects and then i got rid
number three is to make sure your video
collaborative that acting is
without being distracting and if I do
until next time keep practicing keep
about them
live there but if you're buying a
want the physical products that online
else's stuff but you're getting a
later in my life as an adult
your career in fact I want to give you
resume in case you have
than paying for
families this is a true zero percent
had my full-time job when i
there's no way that the casting director
you learn the skills you need to break
forget to get your free audition cheat
another way that actors make money in
specifically to get people like you and
would make a pretty cool addition to
various streams of passive income to get
it's gonna have a physiological effect
and put down less than twenty percent is
or to invest in the self-taping setup at
always working and it might be something
list goes on and on so there's always
things and actions that actually lead to
that we love then happy days we've got
probably told ourselves that
topic is that you could do all of those
to make the movie right
am I more confident am i lifting more
create a casting profile including your
license exam on the first try now as a
united states on december 18th
of the next few years and i'm continuing
the same even the framing is almost
actions speak louder than words don't
are not going to be seen by anyone
guys to take a look at some of these
start with the good stuff sorry anything
to be held more accountable you have to
can also post to social media posting on
all of those things cost money as well
business when i was 17 years old
directors and
this time with the director in the room
unfortunately in the real world there
underneath your statistics you have to
credit is going to be screwed the thing
know one of your classmates is perfect
when that person who lived in another
so what is sag-aftra sag-aftra is a
really cared about now I want to point
casting director does not make
you can take that percentage of your
for them to use anyone else besides you
the last lesson I learned that day came
slower to give up their stuff
because you're actively searching for
strictly pursuing theater as their main
paper mistake number three forgetting to
percent of the home that you actually
the same
films student films and theater
choose to take an in-person classroom
about the acting career so you've been
website or if you want you can scout it
many many credits moving on the next
cash so you're not gonna have you know
it's gonna increase the value of the
way if you looked at my acting resume
control as actors
to date it's still one of the most
seen a huge investment come back
you learn the skills you need to break
example is the show i'm currently
questions when it comes to the stuff
the next question is where should you
avengers endgame is a
needs to be made
part-time and gradually ease my way into
you can also put on if you've done any
take it easy and just know that you can
situation and someone who was more
starting to book speaking roles then you
have been taking this seriously
especially if you're not using your own
private acting teachers private acting
some of you like me to update you on
think about our jobs at work and when
gain that
but it's really not going to help you
also don't forget to smile if your story
agents and casting directors need to
those types of questions for you so
whether it's comments on my youtube
until next time keep practicing keep
oh three day diets or three day three
available to you
way to memorize lines and this is
this month alright so if you want to
casting director but i'm kind of using
another live in or not in person but
any movies that ever filmed in that
necessarily true story and generic brand
but also if you want to really do this
people in a way that's different
those opportunities for the rest of your
and it just doesn't work that way it's
and the most obvious is that you're only
mock audition for the casting director
commercials so for film and TV auditions
get an audition now audition taping
up and if you have any questions
from a financial standpoint i already
start everything from the beginning some
a career in film and television there
valuable content on the Internet
like that available see what agents are
that when i graduated college four years
can prospect after you get home from
then that eligibility does not expire
slimmer let me give you an example I was
on in the past few years here in atlanta
reel to get work and how do i create a
leave them down in the comments below
without paying a premium fee so if you
three a-list actors maggie gyllenhaal
and maybe sand down the surface and
casting networks or backstage this is
sell it or get rid of it if you're
and outs
take them about one month to process the
an online resume for other people in the
subscribe to this channel if you haven't
the front and then on the back should be
you're talking about if you do have a
correct them right now without having to
our careers
incomes reached into the 60s 70s and
particular union the last disclaimer is
an amateur and again
to see you on set one day
relationship between new things and
volunteer your services you say hey
just such an amazing way to do that i
they told us we're too young too old too
audition from each of the actors if they
heaven is what happens when i look at
you reach a plateau
being a vegetarian it didn't work for me
before committing to becoming a real
out on disney plus and i play a school
movie that I never auditioned for they
one day they they said hey we actually
and the medical student's job in this
should also be submitting
science and with a little bit of
casting directors and the director and
colleges in your area and look up if
you can definitely build
monologues a lot in your career
and you've been able to apply your
well-prepared you are you've got your
the line and so for me right now I'm at
works all of this can help you
speaking role in a major movie the movie

about the types of credits
across from them and saying the

discussion points from the book there is
to ask them down in the comments below

little bit weird like stephanie like
instincts because we've all seen enough
estimate your
and it was cut out with scissors would
and you know then I just became more
and then backstage i believe costs 150 a
when you do in solid lights make sure to
character but it's probably going
because i am currently out of town
purposes now you will also hear the term
especially if you've given them so much
i have not seen a single situation where
cliches right so instead of someone
want to be an actor and then you should
everybody should be doing it as long as
agree with more if you like this video
storytellers whether it's a movie a
negotiate you have to work on repairs
actors even there even though you're not
normally do but you know I've shot
have your own company you are working
you take me seriously as a lawyer
lot harder than it looks
them that you're not just an actor that
list of self taping tools that I've
a job that can actually be very flexible
so I definitely recommend doing that and
once upon a time earning a living was
over on Skillshare like of course on how
doing this for a while you moved down to
matter if you're a personal brand or a
before they start filming while they're
clients said to me so Kurt tell me about
me know down in the comments and give me
UK applying to medical school taking
started it's absolutely a sense
but it happens enough where actors need
and what this calculator is going to do
you will find industrial videos and
then make a plan
for a project
pretty obvious one but it's pretty crazy
40 to 45
early on in your career because they can
and now you have someone else that can
you guys if you learn something from it
learning about how
agents out there that you've never heard
over the country this is why I said
then second of all i hope you book it
what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
this and nothing else
with each other and the first ad calls
this property
should really try to find the best

you might have swing dance experience or

looking through lions so that that
now i want to talk about where you may
you rely on your income so much um i
pros and the cons of getting your real
my channel if you want to see more
your training let's talk about how those
yeah that's probably the best thing
tuberosity so your your pelvis just like
were a co-star that's why we would write
book over 50 movies and television shows
and then give me a little bit of time to
comments below
hey guys so in this video we are going
afford it and they'll make large
that is more modern that's more of the
that may have gone the traditional
pennsylvania which is what eventually
recommend trying to get multi-units
that doesn't make sense for a movie
couldn't ask for anything better
rich off making an ass it's really very
think if you're a product business no
platform for math science and computer
after your purchase this number goes up
request and that's it this is the only
isn't to hear you recite facts about
different things and you're not having
back stapled to the back or attached
allowed to audition for union projects
star in exchange for some money and
to do that monologue 100 of the time
this for you you don't need someone to
point here is to tell you to follow your
the audition room and you're drawing a
don't even have to have a fancy camera
and you've prepared for this audition to
too and we've known each other for
invest in a coffee maker they really
see every way that they ask things
definitely covered a lot in this video i
face especially in your eyes but I will
character you know we're gonna be on
you're going to hold yourself back from
wear something that's similar to what
to see you
attendees the opportunity to perform a
down payment as possible
kind of like a commercial it's a
other fees you're paying to maintain the
everything okay
your research on the business then you
gonna talk about that in this video and
talk about something you're genuinely
physical goods and as we've talked about
in the beginning of the process because
there are fewer fees a lot of people
the way an agent actually gets paid is
any way then you can absolutely write
your time there's a lot of information
option for you and you don't want to go
the less processed foods or whole foods
couple casting directors have to say
and other types of investments because
amount of time you're putting it now if
most popular programming language and
for instance game of thrones background
table with a nice view of it's probably
year stations with you and your copy of
top of your resume remember if you have
will be booked off of the initial
thirteen and for me five or ten dollars
sunset and there are even so many other
actor then agents and casting directors
of at this point in your career you're
really hard to throw things away
are specific
has happened to me multiple times i've
commercial copy as well as a storyboard
a day every single day and I know
you know the body needs different
lease payments
things that people will pay you for some
tape is a type of audition where the
that young and i guess it's possible
few bucks and your wallet will be super
running right away here in atlanta so
for where i moved
to kind of save a little bit of money
with the 8 by 10 photo paper now
and understand how all of the pieces fit
going to pay for headshots how am i
schedules we don't have like we're now
real estate is that it can be very
it it helps me kind of it just helps my
into taking some stunt classes
extremely important
where you live let's say you buy a home
rockstar actor and you already booked
have a super interesting story to tell
and i know exactly what every single
your voice
a city nearby
a competitive market you'll want to save
headlines they don't help us
business and you've also
high rate of appreciation then very
value of the house
is gonna be one thousand seven hundred
strict covet protocols and they didn't
long-term rentals buying multi-units and
because actors can also make money off
works for you that's awesome that's what
of how in general the casting process
and a couple lights while recording your
is that first you have to gain
properties you're supposed to depreciate
home to cleveland
so if you are interested in that
18t was like hey we have 300 we also
want to happen is to look boring and
and cast yourself as the main character
that works for you great do that but
obviously you have your improv
it at home but I'll put a link to that
way the camera is not going to be moving
estate you know we have all these
is a business it costs a lot of money to
smaller place because la is so
strong opinions on whether or not actors
is usually used internally
preparation process that has helped me
showed us where we would be sitting and
of acting because that's how you're
remember that every single dime that you
to be honest
the tenants you are officially a
don't make those payments
Vampire Diaries during its final season
there's just that that's it like
unshakable it comes from something that
you when it comes to time to either
to think about and if you're at the
knows right I mean there's no way to
to this point of financial independence
you're putting a full-time effort
energy that we exchange for it
down on yourself understand that simply
per se but i do think they are overrated
it could be chest up it could be waist
very well could have happened i might
the pros and cons are
property then you can rent out those
and they shot shaq's parts
publicly so that actors cannot access
the amount of information you learn
they hate people that live in other
not gonna totally freeze up if that
but when you're first starting out i'd
oh I don't know is that really enough to
credits on your resume now i know what
not show fun or show play the
agent after that so in this video I want
deals whenever they pop up a lot of
and knowing what steps to take
to get even more auditions than what
there are so many opportunities to make
remember when I got there there was
organized with your life and your
step number 10 is to submit to your
haven't heard brilliant is an amazing
what's the difference between the two
basically consists of a bunch of slides
Mike my hot wife comes and kisses me
definitely recommend if some of these 12
on three union product projects and you
as you are a nice person and you're not
workouts yep you'll get that one-on-one
you on your first deal if you're in
saving on taxes into your business then
acting career i'm super happy that that
I do some consultations or goal-setting
someone who knows what they're doing
there and kill it i hope you guys found
unprofessional because it looks like you
room we can't control whether or not we
can do is become an authorized user
already know about and that is
little overrated
inspiration and furnished and it would
mentioned and then you look at okay so
about my dog and that's why you should
have a head shot or a resume and
are websites that i recommend you sign
hi guys and welcome back to my channel
die per se no he have to die okay how
you'll see how much other people have
shoot a self tape audition
seriously you cannot tell a difference
this right at the beginning
of money that we spend
you're basically standing in for the
other things that you can be doing for
make sure that your credit score is in
to you there are actually a number of
though these types of videos
gains with prices nearly doubling over
only applies to the film and television
your days that you worked on set
you just saw there are just so many
you hold on commence your work and baby
some others will have
zone edition b efore and after the store
recommend you learning how to code is
getting the granite or the marble unless
that will help you
had long hair okay
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
just like your digital headshot we need
of my film and TV auditions are on tape
be paying
go out and get takeout for each meal
hours by themselves at their desk making
and then go onto set and be able to
checks came
they're going to say yes i'm going to
word or not there are only a certain
yourself for independent films or
story already is that
drinker drinks
the model for that is that a jab it's
hope you found some value in this video
after two years and likely pay
i drove two hours to pittsburgh i did my
if you want to reduce your taxable
people will purchase right and so
international competitions national
add to it and replace stuff with better
decision for me had i decided to join
them a training video of how to do their
definitely don't want to do that so how
state but i'm willing to work as a local
are often really easy to install so you
in real estate if you one get a mentor
hit those roblots before
that you can do
and i put it all towards studying
column is the name of the show
and definitely shouldn't say in response
you and come back in a frame this way so
you will do awesome i guarantee it so
and to the costume itself could be a
season one and season two of the show
so far everything that we've talked
languages so if you were let's say
successful acting career and for me 10%
dedicated and set yourself down for you
reasonable salary so let's say out of
intent you need to intend to live there
down with an interest rate of 3 and a
great you can put all of that onto your
start step by step
Edison bulb but it wasn't too blue and
into the film and television industry
when i booked my role on cobra kai i
people in ways that i never could
then making a steady income is probably
so avoid them at all costs agents and
to mars
major movies and television shows are
section of your resume
educators versus just um you know the
short films in my acting classes me and
know I'm not certified that's not what I
but he was
different requirements but yeah
can be really it can be anything you
really drill it into my head so let's
number six is to make sure the actor is
there are also opportunities to make
conducting business
the only option but i do think that
refer to either a project breakdown or a
online level one make money online by
said it with
investments back so well and for me it's
agency until you're ready but if you
so if all these people have evolved to
say casting for a teacher role that day
in really great shape they're gonna be
cobra kai i've told this story before
self-employed people to actually qualify
outside of the classroom never from an
the beginning so if you have those two
and secondly we need to find people who
human being
self tapping commandment number four is
um the opportunity cost of potentially
foundation of acting
into the film and television industry
not a background role a principal role
thousand dollars in the bank
business especially especially when it
know most of our guests won't even go to
extra couple hours whatever it is but
description so let's go back to my
i was just
printer if you do check to see if it can
and I sat down and I was super
remove the
increasingly come to associate
the training and i should have done it
amount of time that i have been working
that's not working I'll try another if I
minutes but this was well beyond that
if the financial side is in place and
but if you're willing to take that risk
having to get new headshots taken
in the course that is
being said
let's say they post an audition for a
somebody checking people in at the front
first of all you don't pay them any
just doing commercials
point that we're not really making a
it because at the time
kai on netflix
to help tell the story
instead we are making and dying we are
roles that need to be cast from the
still getting a paycheck
will put my audition sides on my
since my first audition to the day they
try and buy in your area if you can if
question like so many other questions in
the description below one more thing
also put it in the film section you
is creating an s corp a lot of people
with your employment is look at your
your body does have a place to progress
Strasburg method
maybe take my shirt off to make it more
book the room in an audition your
memorization techniques that I used
in the hope that it's going to bring us
possible for you to lose all your money
learning uh how to work with a scene
means that you literally get to live for
and because of that
between matte photo paper and glossy
imagine the person that you're talking
not sustainable and it's okay if you
just finish off these three columns
if you're trying to get into better
mentioned in last week's video i'm
we're going to chat all about how to
better position to succeed because it's
apartment because i know
have a job as a doctor in a german
since you're dressed a hundred percent
get together with some other actors and
do on the internet wherever you are in
one particular type of customer
there are so many different things that
properties the lender will actually use
the full commercial if you want to watch
never from a casting director never from
learning and i can't wait to see you on
actually doesn't charge you
have any questions if you like this
started hey friends welcome back to the
money for example if you're trying to
we will want to speak with a mortgage
popular back in the day and now the
worry about
helped give them confidence that i was
monthly housing payment the housing
casting websites like actors access and
programs for future directors future
best for you and if that means to put on
i make a ton of content about real
the curtain of how this whole casting
because while there are many cities that
things so automated and you're working
doing all the stuff for myself my income
as a way of acting they only think about
world and they'll still
happens when an actor gets
other pros to real estate investing as
on your cars on student loans all that
commercials on the other hand are 30
i wish i would have done
up for some type of practice question
before they even get to you so sometimes
list is buying bottled water this is a
it's made a lot of people very rich and
going to survive when acting's not
two weeks of full-time work and then we
the more your money is going to grow
button and also subscribe to my channel
then I've created a free audit cheat
head your most in your world is
that can definitely be a write-off there
to perform a certain thing on set
10 years old um wouldn't you be like
movies and television shows
by a professional photographer you want
now that the casting director has
real estate investor i still do think
marketing um there's this general rule
percent higher as your credit score gets
self submit for but remember to select
real estate but if no one knows that you
situation getting clients is the hardest
this video helpful
seriously the biggest risk for a seller
professional career here in Atlanta and
understand that these cities have really
you look more like a professional actor
earlier when it came to pit education
business right you could hire them to
every single month they get hundreds of
kind of stuff but if you want to learn
home purchase without anything down so
but he was never listed on the call
and they'll be more willing to hire you
told a story as actors we are
that next year this home is gonna be
booking some of these auditions that
if you book an acting job and you make
is to find the lender and get a
guide that i call my audition cheat
how to add a television credit to your
it takes a lot of time and effort and
auditions 10 percent that means 90
determine what price range you should be
life purpose
non-union productions that have been
they actually just spring for a
rich but seeing my parents still be so
conventional loan they're going to
for your auditions the more that you do
television shows then I've created a
i know some of you that watch my videos
really think it's like pretty guaranteed
Stanislavski Stella Adler Chekhov the
especially in something like real estate
well take risks and put yourself in the
where you are not given the sides or the
are much later in your career and you
example in palo alto where i was raised
home so we're gonna use that as the
multi-unit property then yeah you can
to wait five days before you purchase
right the fifth step
or director or even an acting coach or
you'll cut out those Commission costs
my own agent has said that when she gets
because these are the first small steps
you'll have to pay for as an actor
the time we still have like irregular
afford homes less and less and less one
and what you're gonna do in those
just owning a few small properties in
decision for you
one of the major
i want to be an actor how do i get an
other factors that we don't have any
casting website so don't expect to see
investments in my business just as a
10-step audition preparation guide you
a very new saltwater custom pool with
and link people to it and everything
with a conventional loan but no you will
so in this video we're going to talk
having like a specific focus or you know
times and then just
keep pushing forward now with all of
type of practice question bank this is
two other actors using it to memorize
thousand dollars but that's what it
okay with roommates
that's going to be made
some point where the description of the
love with her and animals world with an
single week today we're talking about
besides the money part there are tons of
have a degree they only care if you are
workflows and the back end of things a
as small well one thing you can do is to
answers right they could see solutions
have mentorships we have technology we
union actors for certain auditions
frequent occurrence
we're talking about the other nine ways
of bringing in enough income to cover
character is exactly your height and
online classes you also don't need to
as well because they can just join in
thinking that you want to maybe stop
it pays three hundred dollars and it's
and really never pay taxes on any of the
and live a healthier lifestyle it can be
and I think you will as well I've put
along with your audition so the name of
year old curt would have been like
from books from academic papers from
times higher now even though you might
and abilities
billing co-star guest or recurring
only talking about sag-aftra this
audition please and they're probably the
using the actual expenses method and
not use props at all okay now let's
do you have consistent bookings in your
personal finance entrepreneurship and
previous steps and have
money from the seller you can ask them
commercial at all
audition for and work on both non-union
broker yourself so the next step is
long run step number five find
okay so this is the standard top section
director then takes that script
going to be stronger
pretty controversial thing in my opinion
sell it yourself not have to pay that
of your prior work
dialog of the computer select 8 by 10 as
so we had to go out and pay for someone
going to be in the commercial so now
career as well
it does cost three thousand dollars the
want to go into a traditional career i'm
right next to and then I could squeeze
leveraged investment the second thing
scenes set up and shot felt a lot faster
and then finally this is one final thing
step in the process
not work in another and this has a lot
per month
of this I have struggled with body
if you feel like you're overspending in
or can you start your career from
then it's definitely okay to venture
to negative consequences such as for
the very first exercise in the meisner
over a hundred weddings in the past five
to take theater classes in college where
so whenever you decide to join the union
just like a basketball player has to
to get a role that is a small supporting
comment below or DME if you want some
on it anyways with selling a house of
lifestyle and you are a personal trainer
literally learn anything online and then
auditioning and career advice every
they may invite you
to help them cast the movie the casting
declining each year since 2015. now this
money to pay for the class pay for your
all good scripts and screenplays explore
you will pass the test your first try
business as an actor
their car insurance or they just don't
video you don't need to do that for your
another reason why you should audition
per business mile driven so let's say in
accidentally deleted that last clip so i
earlier or 10 years earlier or 15 years
okay now that we've talked about what
exceptions oftentimes someone will tell
i hope you found this information
that they use that audition to
percentage right now in 2020 twelve
now that you have training and you have
of negotiating contracts and whether or
so so yeah start young and set yourself
more intense work but primarily with
an agent is to follow agents and casting
professional headshots and you've done
you're getting off of these public
top level shows immediately they have to
example for um you know what i'm doing
could save you a tremendous amount of
whole house-hunting process even starts
then like i get a few pennies but if
close to within driving distance to one
not book either of those roles and then
main goal is to get the best ROI I would
changed that actor couldn't make it
that only rich people did one
a union production
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
estate agent so first off is what is a
work on
in person yeah all right all right
I've seen plenty of actors do that I do
which is a server-side programming
all my family calls it because we're so
audition as i thought i would
where internally I was not okay with it
actor really requires you to be
audit sheet that you can download by
paying any taxes
this role but then ultimately i didn't
way that you can break into acting in
this is you taking control of your own
a lot of people have been asking about
actors who are not at that level
the us is 703 which is not too bad and
extravagant it is
salary so you can put in up to 19.5 000
depending on your loan size and that's
of them came from a theater background
the other side
is in commercials a lot of actors make a
that is a one-time fee it's not annual
and i'll link them down below i got all
mark or though say hey can we walk over
of actually finding value at properties
in the nba
build your equity in the home and yeah
instead of going live and in person
resume this is
what other photographers are doing
that all of the great acting that we're
student films
and whereas for union productions you
to not become an invisible agent which
a book called Jab Jab Jab right hook and
will be a major step in your career your
let me know what you think about this
through real estate Express which I very
had so in this video I want to share
people for your first rental
this seriously
what happened
commercials and industrial videos
they are looking for actors who have
thing that i would tell you to have is
closing costs by running something here
you're paying in taxes and you already
master housewives the art world ends
best way to invest money for a reason
you do eventually submit to an
a manager
this office space i was this close to
homes actually yes you definitely need
saved up
after 30 days of working your second
um it seemed like a super nice guy
and i drove
and then telling that to the agent
you think about you
member a cold-read is a type of audition
the idea of
going to have three units that you can
and she apologized because she said it
residence the reason why this is amazing
you don't want to make going
don't take your voice in your subject of
400 per month so that rental to value
to start doing plays in school
look at real estate
like this and when you do that it makes
reference the the patient's chart and
a whopping 1825
have to make sure that your parent has
move right away
in my career i will get to be in another
and acting here in the united states
than their own bodies right use what you
and the third thing is you have to sign
and if you sign me you won't regret it
you don't book it now before we get into
best if not best loan programs out there
consideration well like i mentioned
someone lived in another country and
express so i went ahead and just took my
audition but others will have a callback
every audition is an opportunity for you
i hope this clears things up a little
go in person to a classroom and in my
people involved in it are in it to make
your expenses to cover your salary
spending some time here with me today
like LED lights inside so at night you
character was in their 20s or 30s as
a lot of you guys have heard the stat
Stevens called this no-nonsense cop type
what casting platforms
i get paid for no matter what and
start making content there
buying those brand name products
certainly is not required
years which is exactly the point they
it's a one-time three thousand dollar
twenty seven hundred dollars per month
a very different quote like i guarantee
know necessarily what your goals are
and then
and that just goes to show you that they
when we shot my scenes they did give me
and that's something that profit first
give it to them right away you should be
these are things that are outside of our
and on this channel we explore the
start recording high quality audition
take your money by offering you false
more money with increased levels of
majority of my time actually taking
college offers them and if you're out of
running the numbers is so important too
people having a smaller space means it's
such as business meals printing ink gas
that was step 11. step 12
individual can find auditions off of
all right
cheat sheet which is the process that i
had no experience acting in movies and
personally do real estate part-time i
imdb profile but you don't need to do
lead characters of the show
there are some people that you'd like to
any money that you make as an actor here
need to track the things that will
your real estate license and get into
anything for two days and on the third
medical school standardized patient it
accents and don't forget audition
there are a lot of vegans who you know
the acting career center here to help
career is quite the roller coaster ride
the first six to 12 months or better
most stores release their brand new
workouts you know that's not something
they will very likely ask you to
a professional one
normal printer paper which is eight and
should be the same way you know because
is because when you have a brand that is
also being and deception lasting dry
that you can do while
huge long career yet but i still feel
in the moment and they don't think of
100 focused on building my career
rid of that pretty easily and another
would recommend you probably stay away
for working those days no matter what
anywhere where do you think he could
nail your audition every single time so
of hundreds of head shots
teacher right so let's say instead you
maybe that role description is only of
we're not in a position to better
yeah but until then you know you gotta
all right that was a step-by-step
my other issue with
be overkill
units and even better is a fourplex
if you only think about the future and
altogether if that's what we want now
and butterflies with five or six nations
recommend most people do you'll have a
used in other countries
care professional to really help you out
3% over asking price so I just wanted to
want to save money they're doing this
and you need to focus the majority of
world ends and turn the going gets rough
not for casting purposes but for kind of
understand that your acting ability
hamstring all those things and since
for a while you can start building up a
know obviously you have to pay for an
and i have the ability to work on
money that you can make not only on the
a lot of other things i say for most
with a project for casting purposes so
you today is to do an activity while
where I was able to get out of that
because before they moved in or sorry
print photos so check if your current
boring audition after boring audition if

before I close my eyes and actually try
from about
resumes my advice would be to start with
meryl streep

the acting career center here to help
of article you and never will i know how
instead of getting a degree in acting
network name or the streaming service
for roles that were originally written
show that you really want to be on as a
but um atlanta's grown a ton in atlanta
where you have three rentable units
helps other people to see my channel it
of what you are responding to this
every single week today we're talking
it's basically when you're getting a
money for a lot of people that don't
you need to be an expert as well ask
they go directly to agents and will not
find something that brings a smile to
just drop and do a plank for no reason
if I get to sleep for eight hours which
submit yourself for acting jobs without
well-known and well-respected casting
you can help you know help people find
theater you'll have
would write supporting and
things so
you're just getting started and you go
and it looks completely new now as for
make sure you do it right you are
isn't laugh-out-loud funny or super
oftentimes what you're really gaining
in the room in front of the casting
and then step 13 is the final step the
your business is going to grow
is a huge step in building up another
that are extremely rewarding
actors remind them of their ex what can
start doing that today get those free

atlanta home studio today that's because
all right so today we're talking about
actors and then you would tell facebook
from my first commercial
that shaq was going to be involved i was
the pursuit of an
properties that you do want to buy these
you take something like an
not completely
can offer
interaction or at least the group
are willing to pay for that skill
this state
out how much house you can actually
tons of parts of the country because
flooring to new porcelain tiles
so that totally makes sense that it's
just asking questions and then me
and they wanted me to audition again the
audition typically your eyes are going
you can even create email notifications
thumbs up and if you have any questions
after working your second union job
early in the morning so if I go to sleep
their level of acting ability well this
a critical mistake that an actor makes
everything to online courses to more
or two but these types of roles on
tomorrow and this is the food I'm gonna
that so we as actors we need to stop
along um it's just been so awesome
do have a regular schedule some days we
own screenplay write your own short film
then they get an idea of your abilities
frame it from mid-chest to the top of
learning and i can't wait to see you on
want to let you guys know that you don't
used much more often than printed
offers a lot of mentorship and training
out there who
like you can have the role but you also
submit for an audition uh casting
thicker paper it's not flimsy like
emulate the actual questions on the
actually just hire your kids this is a
the bank
movies and tv shows now and i've gotten
bring headshots to auditions always all
some of these smaller
to the actors they represent so unless
think about like
self taped audition request from a
cover the six foundational movement
close on your property this is step
with a forum and a podcast
longer in the movie
lee george lucas black panther
you must join sag-aftra
the more your sales will grow which is
and then i will also put the director
than performing a monologue look it just
worth it no matter if you want to pursue
stupid tell me about yourself question
someone else if you do choose to pay
fifteen thousand dollars more in a year
train again then I can train again
own children and they're under 18 years
and i sent it to my agent and they sent
yeah he's going and then going through
want to pay them and then have them pay
applying for admission to college and
lot of actors who
could completely change your whole real
i say us i'm kind of putting myself in
just go in and find what's on sale and
percent down so this VA loan greatly
have to go that far you could do
need that mentorship and that training
can set up a lot of automations so
for it i promise you it is so
of e-commerce purchases
there are a lot of other metrics that
the next video thanks so much for
about these types of warranties
netflix youtube premium hulu disney plus
for those reasons i have zero regrets
if everybody is telling them that here's
it's like this really beautiful color
those rules don't apply so for instance
megabits per second versus
i make a ton of content about personal
army green t-shirt to suggest the
those lines rock-solid inside you
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
a link to it in the description below in
books and today we're talking about
and I think personally more trouble than
marketing is everything the best case
they might seem quite small at five
websites out there so Redfin Zillow
if you have any follow-up questions feel
well you mentioned results and it's you
every single week
and sit down and figure out how much you
representation finding representation
this is really one of the best ways for
more likely to consider hiring you to
instead of a monologue i've talked about
my own personal pages I also posted it
the audition that landed the role on
actually looks
video they're a fantastic online
helps if you're trying to sell any kind
like your drama club or school plays
an escort now when you're doing work as
of pocket each and every month but
recycle these questions and points
last of us will be used in the
weight sure and that's when you know
you might as well buy more units if you
those type of things happen in those
in the home this is basically just like
quality then and there's someone you can
and the south east if i work on a union
wanted to
just buy a condo or a single family
to commercials they're
and for good reason it's the most
certification exams and those costs
nobody's going to be able to make that
first column is pretty self-explanatory
idea of how this scene should look a cop
that's a reason why you should always
more turnkey but there are some things
I have to look at the screen to see
two i think the experience that you get
nine on my list is
if you are watching this video it means
I see they're super low and you have to
actors to have a backstage account
people you know one they only need 30
thing I do before I get ready for bed no
right because talk is cheap actions
so again we're going to bold this
planning on shooting us shooting this
for over and over again
then let me tell you this i think there
key bolded words and then spending the
city you currently live in
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
casting directors
might go to a set that has lamb for for
four ways to get a talent agent if
meisner technique
if you have any questions make sure to
that audition right
written however as they moved along in
license I got mine in two months so all
currently don't have a printer then you
have to pay annual dues annual base dues
overdo your makeup and when your
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
give you an audition for our project
you know in the past that you want to
anywhere in the world no matter what
every year only a very small percentage
that goes into doing a play but
upload so how do you keep your file size
they've seen commercials being done and
trying to improve themselves
become an actor now
sense and I know that it's it's been
there's a lot of great stuff both on the
glasses that allows you to see
and last name I like to name my headshot
training is the first thing you should
actually in line with what we say we
number one have at least
it it's definitely the safer way it's
the LTV the more risky that loan is
high costs of living so you should
of how we can make money in our careers
will have
photography business and growing a
do you regret not doing more theater
i'm really good at it and what am i
to get a professional headshot you may
people are gonna like it and you won't
should do it and secondly because money
and that's what happened with my first
any age like yes even if you're 15 years
smaller market might cost a little bit
or by going to the link in the
your state this can take
that's nearby
to succeed in real estate you do not
coaching and personal training on
I'm non-pro has a copy of it at the end
that those can be great ways to start
description if the writer or the
i mean trader joe's has pretty good
so i would have gone from getting you
i am a plumber she goes on to make the
acting classes in your city
particular role because
pays lenders and banks for losses due to
that's a lot harder try three of them go
give yourself some buffer time before
theater they want to be
in your region it's also a good idea to
that only i can do and the only thing
we're going to talk about three headshot
you'll actually be able to fill out an
agent this
meal planning is it whatever right well
and I hope to see you on set one day
of your income and you're not really the
remember to subscribe until next time
is the average over time over hundreds
just getting your own one bedroom place
that's helped me book over 50 movies and
actually pushed me forward and what when
and then production had to scramble and
pass that as well so the first step is
something came up and we're gonna film
had no idea
multiply that by let's say 0.4 and that
keep practicing keep
actor's career
baseline that almost everyone is going
heard most often throughout my career is
we're lucky enough to be doing a job
they'll be subject to about the 20
lowest you're ever going to find
on the days that we're working so how do
other principle performer who isn't a
same time now let me pause here for a
is going to be the best route to take
in the united states but i was in the
live promotional periods but also you
they can help you out and buying your
but you probably don't have to think
whatever city you live in right now even
seeing that every day that's that's
at Sun truss Park
you would do is you would write down in
in bold i want to put all the title
either co-star guest star recurring
ethnicity and a short description of the
no bad about that but it's just
is training to make sure that they are
website then once you've done that you
interest now whatever money you're
or let me text you a link and then they
able to control
and yeah the way that they ask things
were wearing a button-down shirt and
a full gym if you know how to use your
you can learn when I was 12 I decided I
spend in your business what your
television audition or for a self taped
saying hey agent
build trust from the person who is
remember the story that i told you about
house is now worth
everything and ultimately it does make
definitely decrease your taxable income
and if you let imposter syndrome stop
and see if they go to your city or maybe
for real estate investing especially if
their careers they decide they want to
matter what it is it has to be something
doubt i could have done what i've been
hometown of Cleveland have opportunities
kind of newer in the industry or just
money for yourself tapes is to find a
wait to see you on set one day
agent and you have some commercial
highlights from some of my favorite
that same $500,000 home you're putting
i think it makes them
if I hadn't been as prepared as I was it
team of buyers agents listing agents
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
that I've learned to help you jump-start
skill share class on how to edit videos
this is how i've been taking acting
starbucks and you're just spending five
most actors start out living in some
hey guys so in this video we are going
you just buy things on sale
by far been one of the best investments
their research and don't know how to
because think about it we're only
never really done this myself and I
that is unless you find a good tenant
them believable and compelling such as
callback what yeah whatever this movie's
you live in a right to work state
need specifically
were 20 or or 15 or
a scenario for you to act out
estate license to maybe get your loan
other because they have to have some way
honey wagon you might get called in you
like i've done with mine otherwise you
the seller is not going to take you
um for very much longer and you have the
have photographed
helpful because i really do
in multi-unit rentals and of course
your credit score and i have this first
just want to share a few updates i know
like button and also subscribe to my
help me with serving my clients really
the book taken care of in the breakdown
all that to continue so that as a 26
homework assignments but besides that
if you really want to grow you're going
all the time it's important to spend
leave them down in the comments below
to foreclose on the house that's a lot
this is a pretty basic tripod you can
about yourself question let's talk about
single i and don't forget to check out
and trust you hopefully you know through
possible while this certainly helps you
it's just been awesome to see
will just have it and friends never dead
like that you know you can go on
george in a couple episodes in season
so if this is something that you're
has continued to help me to this very
we're at right now and even before the
audition exchange i've done that for
industry and that's how I approach what
to increase stability in my body I want
the interest rate you get is
doing this but just to simplify for
always look at the store brand or
various things and I would bid on those
whole story
is not monetary the real cost
to them they're going to ask for a
secondly people in the internet I got
direct path that works for everybody we
to talk about this for a reason of
hours you'll pass the final exam for
interesting on set experiences I've ever
audition so if there's a TV on in the
they're gonna spend a ton of time on
an imdb pro account costs 150
completely off-guard like I was when
yeah what's up guys it's Kurt from small
movie started production the director
taking it to a whole new level
who really have no interest in doing
then on the second column i'm going to
i make a ton of content about personal
different strategies
here in the united states okay so the
successful in real estate you want to be
unless you are a big time celebrity you
you know there's just there's so many
license with a brokerage and this is
to house hack your way to a zero dollar
closes all right the seventh and final
wedding photography consultation
brilliant or Connelly sponsoring this
and you are a sag-aftra member now
amazing tool that you can use not only
and of us because i have in the
hang out we're typically right here in
video editor
two hours to pittsburgh i did my
was sometime in the early afternoon
this stuff obviously applies to everyone
that's 135 hours of in-class time
when there is a show that's filming in
who takes family portraits at Sears but
know maintenance days are really great
able to share more
the name of the director
as your primary residence that and you
me wrong
that I necessarily specialize and but
but if you're one of the other 99 of
all know that an actor's headshot is
got a good idea of what's written at
that's not working I'll try another if
career center website
take a commission
13 years now
guided introduction to becoming an agent
would be a typical cold-read situation
how they were able to make that happen
perfectly over time by just flooding the
lot to me because you know internally
when you want to run your own
find a good tenant that will make your
and commercials
up for
the quote unquote wrong choices but
very successful if you put in your full
right so this is totally fine i'm gonna
in the commercial so how cool is that i
important for this place to make it look
you don't need that right away i think
as well as they do have really good
best market to move to
and not your mouth and speak today gonna
factors that go into a casting decision
Kennesaw right next to the Kennesaw
at this price ever like this is the
corrosion in this video i wanna be yours
until next time break legs and I hope to
one sentence when you read through a
best bet this is because if you want to
lower and lower that means that your
calculator so a tool like this is
she says to dress in whatever way that
start working for you
act and i'm not talking about acting in
those cases they may have
get y dollars of equity if y is greater
for the season those products aren't
commandments let me tell you about a
if i wanted to be a chef in a japanese
doing more stuff you'll be doing maybe a
that will require you to get an agent
la new york or seattle they saw huge
live outside of north america
agencies are looking for actors with
prevent living paycheck to paycheck
and he paid me thirty pounds for it so
very important and it's your first
it showcases more of your acting
and then start browsing the public
marvel movie to the general public
money they're willing to lend you it
little pop-up right there ok let's talk
different insurance carriers the range
how many submissions do you get every
their careers
process works
going to make 50 calls each day or door
really great interest rates this means
guidance is so important as well as your
not in obligation and a lot of times
don't think it is
and website so my brand is from or my
and i definitely recommend taking
going to help you out much in the field
great five minute long story to tell
knows maybe
cover your bills in case you don't close
hgtv ish the houses the easier it's
first property it's not as simple as you
cameras these days and they're going to
ground producers who are trying to get
jobs are 4050 hours per week right that
years however lots of things in the home
backstage actors access casting networks
and here in the united states the major
maybe actually quit don't quit please
by line and then I'll push play for the
lives and we're talking about money in
there is no PMI payments no mortgage
look when you do a monologue you have to
part of the flooring the floors
send it off for a fee
of those things
if you played luke skywalker in star
through middle school through high
actors are not your nutritional health
time and as someone who
and friday so be sure to stay tuned for
get to bed at a certain time because I'm
to seventeen thousand dollars
questions that they want us to improvise
for the most part you're not going to be
all the time that acting and auditioning
they work a 40-hour work week and they
this is kind of where you have to start
on set one day
throughout space but also how its
this we are almost always doing
before buying your first
so if you haven't already make sure
they're gonna make your ROI even better
Lowe's or Home Depot during a sale
rent out or buy your house so they call
i think this is where experience really
forget to download my free audition
relatively late compared to i guess a
service go through and memorize the
some will have one round of callbacks
and put the mother on whats welcome to world
to guess on which one it is or if it's
it can be crazy scary to do something
you get from a local mortgage broker is
three hours when people think about it
different so if you're not 18 years old
throughout my entire career
I asked Jordan what her thoughts were on
performer and whether or not they are
on a piece of paper so let's say these
driving around town and all and I'll use
example let's say there's a new movie
costing you to keep that item
community of it to help them to move
of doubts we go through seasons of
in this video
things that you should definitely avoid
have to have every single role yeah I'm
actually repair things
today's appliances are generally
to 30 000 in taxes on the sale now the
was supposed to be a surprise
because they have to make that money
here and I agree with that to an extent
just having this swinging down by my
and also you know getting that
like what just happened and how long you
different cities around the world
need to be made in order to pursue this
what I mean by that is
always focusing on that and then this
recommend finding a brokerage that
every single audition is a win even if
guys in the next video
that being said how good your audition
time watching one of my videos
your acting abilities
set and networking opportunities and all
it comes with the territory that's part
the value of the home is 10 times higher
something like that let's say your
in reality a lot of broke people will
as well this is important because as you
top three or top five
amazing house hacking can be and take
created a free
really wanted to get you on this show so
advantage to not dressing in full
right so that means
and maybe you can get a part in one of
the question that you came here for when
but it is a way that you can make money
from watching Paul Wesley and Candace
first one
you work background
of their income on housing so just think
but i'm excited to see
strategy to pass the salesperson brokers
your money is working for you so
reserved for homes that are pretty
property with a bigger price tag
uh chicago new york atlanta and some of
what you're doing when you're
director said
been footage on my demo reel and a great
taxed income income that shows up
in capital gains or if you're married
pay you for that online education you
if you like this video please give it a
your profiles on these websites are
confident that I could make this place
into my story
especially with the rise of e-commerce
they were brand new
out of wherever i live and then i'll
time to make it happen and a lot of
50 of the projected rental income as
look up that particular department and
website is
table from someone that they're
premium that FHA loans have so that's
he decided that in one of the scenes the
and then divide that by the total square
attention away from your performance so
specifically for that medium so i highly
up and hit subscribe because when you do
we're going to change this to 8 by 10 to
hardworking and ethical agents to join
we mentioned earlier actors have
are a lot of actors out there that are
there's a lot more to it than just
I ever uploaded and to this day it's
i'm going to try to give you the best
how you manage and
heart of a girl thing well i
easy is it going to be to sell this
well the higher your credit score the
about the audition preparation process
intense all the time sometimes just kind
lot of these things you can do yourself
and as you buy more and more properties
but these are just like independent
and i wanted to share a story from
charge you a fee another way is to go
service isn't and just there's just like
that know like and trust you at that
and then the walking dead is on amc
incredible show you don't even have to
are released and this happens all the
it more
need to find people who are willing to
okay well that's the end of that job
costume for a specific character you
worry about that don't worry about
new who are just getting started if you
than a hundred dollars
your career
like tunnel vision focused on i want to
to look for this increases your chance
wow that was a professional actor and if
traditional brokerages they're smaller
anyways i hope you guys found this video
were to
landlord you'll collect checks each
doctors so by the same token agents sign
that's why i encourage you to get advice
it doesn't and do we do some bicep curls
world go and look at what movements what
person so that every day at the end of
it's much more beneficial for someone
down for four seconds you'll see what
give you kind of a bird's-eye view
legitimate well
asked me how old i was at the time i was
puzzle so
do with this part of setting is refresh
the risk that you're taking there is
auditions without an agent is to browse
is running off your car what you want to
walking my dog and doing this I'll go be
student films and non-union indie films
know it can be scary
anything that quickly but yeah i'm sure
for their self taping now if you want to
and she says that if they don't already
this is the step where you should just
this is both when you're talking about
week but i would say
ask your real estate agent to send you
has a
guess what it's also possible to be too
sheet that you can download from the
helping out with a casting session one
square foot lot so it's a pretty big
videos of them acting so that i know
your resume will not have a lot of stuff
trying to do it and to give you great
the way that i was able to grow
the age is 40s or 50s and you're only in
that car that's popping up right now all
find Brandon anyway trying to show you
happened because this should have been
medical interviews so that makes some
right now almost everybody has a phone
one is going to come to you and you
agent to help me get those credits
the entire customer experience we are
self-conscious and self-centered i think
working on
ridiculous doesn't it
booked the room
career earlier
the 3430 group does is it shows people
now I actually moved down here from Ohio
taking in the scenery I was checking out
is the first step for every aspiring
curtain just make sure it's a neutral
that's it for this video if you liked it
allow you to use gift funds from
main character who was played by maggie
you know or podcast YouTube channel
you know the thing about that is it is
unfortunately it's not that simple
my channel to see more videos just like
days after that
experiences as well as the advice of two
to record your auditions at home and
and entrepreneurship so that's it for
all all they knew was
I'll just grab this from my nightstand
don't want to over renovate ideally
forth on the wall and catching it but no
just in the business side of things
shot of tequila at the bar
ethnicities of all shapes and sizes
example from my personal experience
your school whether they're drama club
still no mention of shaq nobody told me
knowledge pretty well you've actively
this is where i want to make a
where you will definitely need to pursue
hopefully see you soon hopefully see you
is click over to manual and then down
writing in the middle of it
director has it in their heads that the
they stop joking around
time if not then
course one of the most important things
first time you were asked tell me about
hit the tab
could be but it would need to be more
you know perfect tie-in with Fitness's
out of Los Angeles
that are written right once you get to
the main goal of sag-aftra is to provide
until next time keep practicing keep
see their acting ability hope that all
even helping a casting director in a
production company and the production
great workout in this you know closet
that we talked about
more importantly it's gonna look a lot
then i expect them to have a
probably aren't taking right now and
that and jump on that opportunity
inference and information theory
that age
out and you're burning yourself out of
cheat sheet if you haven't already
different ways that actors make money
background work or being an extra now
anybody else in this industry
to emphasize here are not to rush to get
you have to do this but you're also able
personal brand that professional
just tossing a tennis ball back and
how many of them do you know let's find
the proper dimensions remember when we
and then on the third day i found out
hiring an agent you're not going to rely
charge you a lot less than a pro
and then if they like what they see then
be doing a lot of real estate investing
income and help you save a lot of money
totally different story
taking acting classes
whatever region that you're in
they're afraid they're going to be too
then send it to them
get that and so it's just you know we
interest rates down payment and all
you're still going to have to work just
that casting director to keep you in
instead of writing that you could write
of most people most people never get
as far as timing is concerned you know
stay on top of their craft
your bedrooms so if you want to impress
in the eight years that i was acting in
who joins and who joins us inside
