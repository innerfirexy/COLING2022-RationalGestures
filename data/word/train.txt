some of the core stuff you might not
with a monologue it can be applied to
taking this is really
need anything close to 20% when you're
here in atlanta it only cost
of these major markets
being specific about what exactly it is
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
make 130
reggae fest snow red shot with one and
how can you prepare a really really
off of reruns on a network or
let's say create logos for companies
a multi-million dollar movie set and
really succeed you want to spend money
you're just getting started
rehearsal the point here is that I
and the better of a deal you're gonna
big budget 100 million dollar project
then connect the two of you
months i would err on the side of
there are many things that you should be
payment of 10% and in terms of the LTV
so now you might be thinking wow that
can give you a few general tips first
really high credit score
on social media a lot of times they'll
and not being able to save enough money
microphone this is why I like to use
performance great now we're getting
any education expenses if you're an
audition for those coveted roles and
at its core money is just a medium for
one to two times and make sure you
they decided to just choose from the
role if you're not okay with this and it
i would also recommend putting it on
play back plate i switched off star wars
they know who to pick
right to it the first way that we are
needs to be stable and it has to be
make all of the digital products that we
but no it happened to me and that's the
when you buy an
my clients but if they don't implement
exams that are based on the topics that
thousand dollars all the way to fifty a
two or top three choices and they hadn't
also work on non-union projects
another really great resource that you
guys ways to become financially
maybe 70 80 bucks so you're paying that
in front of their store it is the
another thing that you won't have to
directors on social media like we talked
pretty much work on it whenever you want
we also want to make sure they can see
and you have the opportunity to act in a
thing because
what this is is you're basically going
first time here make sure to subscribe
those locations
so many different streaming services
with head shots the next thing that
and I hope to see you on set one day
business card the two main points I want
her website templates if you're
audition would be justified okay that's
never auditioning for just that one role
to have this down by my side or
a headshot and you have a resume
probably not but it might have helped it
in that market and you might be able to
the slaughter of your play store Was it
relocating costs money the moving costs
types of student films i'd
an fha loan but that isn't the case
i can send you these are the summaries
here you would write your character this
and that is level one services level two
follow along if you don't want to hear
at for example the cap rate right here
one of those actors in that small
theater experience in their background
matters because if you don't know why
roles that were written for someone in
especially if you want to prioritize
as a self-employed person myself i've
found it informative please give it a
buyer's agent is paid for by the seller
do in general you need to know how to
much cash to work with is you can just
happening well your body is using itself
choose one to work you can choose one to
codes all the time that get you to it
probably won't have any television or
so we have these granite countertops
learn that this can be another way that
body and just your body weight to create
bank's atm this is entirely
opportunities basically the same as an
have many many scenes that you're trying
is important to also look at the
or whenever they
I went to play football in basketball at
to give them a second round of auditions
say is when you are investing in
haven't already and if you're a newer
saw the house two days before the actual
those extra expenses so they can hire me
you to arrive on set on time to arrive
when you're just getting started in your
necessary or you can watch it later and
your area step number two is to start
people if you've got the right audience
two on my list is
before making that big move because
schedule like a lot of actors do it's
get a really good sense on how they
money that we don't see unless we
have any baby famous playing the lead
talk about today's topic which is how
afraid to turn things down yes they're
phone number on it at the time don't
business works and how you as the actor
may seem like a small detail it may seem
buying multi-unit properties
how are you going to stand out to a
to get started now that being said let
your career because
but if you can actually use that car
is asked is to strike up a conversation
to get this house sold so fast so yeah
well they're going to need that actor to
but they are not the final decision
those deals and like i mentioned earlier
why not do this
500 000 which means that there is a
headshots inside it and go put it in
can't see yourself doing anything else
know you're spending more money and and
you have to make offers you have to
are you able to get a flight and be
shoulder blown out of knee the back
guy who books 10% of his auditions so if
you do why else would you be watching
that doesn't mean that it doesn't come
unlivable basement and then add a
second memorization technique is to
i think it's really important to
rehearsal rehearsals up and action I
up and if you have any questions leave
in this scene on set while we were there
that have different experiences than me
job if you
extremely important and making waves and
productions are terrible
definitely help you in preparing for
state exam
will be chapter summaries for you to go
confidence comes from somewhere else
step number seven is to learn how to
pictures stand out so obviously the
desperation and it's just not attractive
sign up for auto pay all right number 12
outside of class on the weekends and
website or whatever right yeah so when
and i want to separate that question
will send out one audition of one role
that you show up in the world
with the item so if you have items like
exam and when you pass that final exam
old or too
seconds long and are usually selling a
needs to be able to fit in this story
you don't look like your headshot
is possible to turn his liquid and
website that link is in the description
three hours of your week there's a
the crew was getting ready to shoot and
casting networks
interested in that video i'll put a link
agent now the last thing i want to
loans is be lower your credit score the
there's a people in real life or
where i
investing you need to have a good
and this actually happens quite a lot in
pursuing a different career
because i don't have any full-time w-2
even hundreds of thousands of dollars in
try to squeeze
of a movie or a television show
and Sharon B Ali the casting director
something like that right a lot of times
my friend Tyler Buckingham who is an
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
you are saving money all right number
part of an audition is what's going on
is an investment in yourself if you
estate transaction i can almost
out to other people they're
right they're going to push that person
buying photo paper for headshots is that
chance of booking the part but when it
we enjoy more or even to stop working
side when they're watching your demo
i book something
the step step where the last day on
standard on a resume there is some
more videos on acting
if you don't have a storage unit it's
well now is where we get into the second
with a lot of production as well like
their income satisfies the debt to
headshots at home come on actually I'm
the exact right dimensions every single
your job as a standardized patient
career in itself all right man this was
and medians you know if you perform much
you can represent yourself as the buyer
told for most of my career and then I'll
before you get into real estate it takes
to rent out i think this is the goal
had to jump through all of those hoops
uh in the 48 hour film competition okay
actually the conventional loan and many
and those sacrifices that have to be
some people have made a ton of money for
take 10-15 minutes maybe 30 minutes I
build up your client list as well as the
from there and you
like i said i've worked on some great
shows agents that
that you could potentially rent out some
you know looked at scale on a daily
throughout my career
the last 13 years like I started off
you can also follow people who do real
important i think that's something that
get experience in acting is especially
credits on my resume if i never had an
happens to fit well then you've got a
they would have all been recorded in the
even more on the only the things that
of a television show i worked one day on
in this video we are exploring some real
that commission
improve yourself as an actor
last minute so give yourself some buffer
mcdonald's commercial
the real estate course it's not really
timed and you have 48 hours to
available upon
companies where i've done training
already heard on and turn to have your
on what she looks for when someone
health teacher my dad was a marathon
casting boards for roles that fit you
had a lot to talk about
all kind of adds up to future residual
who like to wear purple suits and have a
we never got to actually hang out or
the productions were going on
keep 90. if you make a thousand dollars
years you will need it to the world
really used so much
long-term wealth
need to know is that in real estate your
nightstand again turn off the light and
it's your journey and it needs to be
now before we get into today's topic i
memorable performance
we might be in a show a run of a show on
acting teachers what are the websites
your kids already in college
during that conversation she
the show ordinary joe i worked on
great price range and it's gonna hold up
buyers that will probably relate to us
saving me a ton of money in the process
selecting which actors they would like
minutes a day do they can do it at home
something to put on your resume it's
you are committed to
look at all the credits I have on IMDB
but you have to know which ones have the
alright so the coolest part about this
dollars in the last year with your
for principal principal is just any
all the stuff you can write this off in
and there's always been this the stigma
estate license that's amazing
thank you for shouting me out and
for example if you guys were to buy my
basically what you want whether it's a
bit of time to prepare and then you do
recovery and sometimes we don't get to
to also try to get experience on the
this video give me a thumbs up if you
that you can take
what first refusal is first refusal
a payment just because you forgot to
there are no wrong choices there are no
buy that water and lastly it is way
very low pay but just like in any other
atlanta are amazing
be zero and ideally we want the cost of
how do i get an audition for a movie or
right before I go to sleep and six is to
city that is in the la metro area
good thing because it means you have
where you live right now also what if
monologues when i think they should be
70% to pass the test as long as you
and still do extremely well on your
differences and it comes down to okay is
Prius put that on a tripod to stabilize
we are all familiar with
background on what house hacking is
like and trust you is by providing
on the lookout
topics in this video
not be as fun to think about
agent let me remind you that when you do
leaves you with a lot of time to work on
here's a head shot of my actor i promise
and then finally i think the last thing
even college a lot of those places may
about if you got rid of these payments
headshot should be printed on 8 by 10
again so until next time signing off and
practice test go hand in hand with the
before right where
perform a scene they can give you
come from you would
prove to an agent that you are taking
get a dog okay so in an audition like
or i want an audition i'm a really good
individual activity that acting is
have the name of the
spend your time studying for the test
actor because nobody starts with acting
number two is just to be in the game and
agent and not just one way
of the things that you want to buy will
a year but they waive that fee if you
audition and the casting director is
families by just doing commercials
thing you can do is think what types of
that even with a very small amount of
loan programs out there exist
definitely consider what i'm saying and
that tends to take a long time to build
i definitely recommend talking to your
that if we saw it in an audition or as
is that money is what we exchange our
audience so if you can show that you can
maker and then just do it yourself same
so now you might wonder what uh what's
most of the time whenever we have people
estate license let's dive into how you
gonna be where you and your guests are
video and i think this is going to be
convenience until your time becomes
the same as the ones in hollywood
for new salespeople that way you're
you have to do is kind of dedicate
for it the audition is like the actors
lean on well we can't unring this bell
should I dress for the character she
officer who was interviewing a little
buying these rental properties is for
important part
percentage trust me look me up on IMDB
in your life
tenant is stable
so um the point is is that
early as you can is just super super
can just immediately play for the los
the things that I've had this
things right away and when things don't
back on the market and it doesn't look
working on lower budget projects where
your memory about the course i know
ever handling the watch at all now I've
advantage of these retirement plans the
and unless you are already a proficient
it is a roller coaster
agents you will 100 need to do it
everyone is affected by the internet so
need recessed lights now these are the
but if maybe we're not entirely happy
expenses are every year
month from actors looking for
of this when i was living in cleveland
anymore we've moved houses many times
and cons when you're working on
there are services that can do that for
want to work one-on-one I always want to
about yourself question is most commonly
that comes your way you can be patient
the same it's gonna save you at least a
opportunities are out there to audition
first day after every song at most cake
taxes are probably your biggest business
but that's how much of you the camera
falcon in the winter soldier
opportunities and auditions that you
sign up through an agent so if you have
for many other things
certain things that I've tried like
should do it because i'm not really like
character breakdown a project breakdown
audition for them so you better know
monologues in previous videos but if you
imdb or it's just a video on youtube
and making your profit a priority um
overall if you want to spend less money
proven themselves to be ready for the
would say on
as you're memorizing the script you're
and especially if you're brand new
secondly i want you to know that we are
go into a clothing store is
can create your own footage
what felt like milliseconds after we sat
qualified to be doing this
if you have an s corp which i definitely
see a positive balance and be able to
neighborhood to see if that price that
i found out that i got another audition
so many casting directors talk about
like and for me you know whenever i put
do a call a zoom call with the wardrobe
five to six thousand dollars before you
money and all that time
chance to catch it live you can watch it
able to do that anyway but it does make
first thing that popped into my mind was
had the goal when i started my business
spirits with soldiers stories one help
self-doubts if you're having
bathroom and kitchen and all that stuff
get a chance to act and get a chance to
perk about the FHA loan is that they
pain you know that's a really common
they want to see a professional headshot
elected to join the union back in 2019.
and some of the questions were different
so don't discount being in commercials
without an agent and even when you do
up it could be a wider full body shot
with about 160 000 members
overboard if you went to your audition
i'm really excited because if you follow
distinctly remember there was an actress
working in plays working in student
haven't seen that movie yet
roster of all the actors i represent and
acting is an evidence-based profession
middle of my audition to hear the
and you chip away at what doesn't work
audition so i grabbed my headshot and
she looks at what classes they are
paying me any money
application and during that time I
you there are tons and tons of agents
back to one simply means that we're
why and tell me why i am wrong i know
huge video files or streaming netflix on
doing otherwise everyone would be at the
for the days that you work
than just
to hit that subscribe button to get more
phone number down on a back of a
because they can be extremely lucrative
if you look over at my resume i write
you you'll see a lot of your friends
your website down in the comments or in
social media content creation video
on an acting resume so i do not want to
with me and i'll swap and robert swift
beyond or black widow on any of those
and then another thing you need to think
seriously which doctor are you going to
is worth it for most people second is
total nut case
down an average of 11% truth be told the
and some strategies you can use yourself
point where
option you can definitely go and get a
alright let's talk about headshots we
long term you're going to be really glad
would give me the sides then and there
how do you get experience how do you add
into the film and television
as a teenager or as like a 12 year old
should be working on monologues because
you can write off 50 of your costs of
buy or sell a home and if you're just
disclaimers before we get started
commercials because they are just
and then i'm going to open up a blank
life that threaten to steal our money
television and commercial acting
online it's the one I've recommend to
something that normally you would not be
industry experience and knows the ins
you're watching this well into the
like online brokerages that don't take
say you live in kansas city you would go
that shaq was involved in this
all right now that the agent has the
was asking me for my sizes and so I said
extremely uncomfortable for a lot of
about how
right now your credit score sort of
with at least a few options it's always
comes to like this youtube channel but
many great apps that can help you stay
lives a huge chunk of our short time on
focus on real estate then typically most
because normally for investment
don't you just do more theater now
problem and that's a logistical
the time or if you're not working all
body and use it to its full potential so
about is where is your tipping point
seeing success so without further ado
three times
they're gonna do all the work for me now
learning something new
attention but that means it's also very
for people that do voice acting but
understanding that
statistics so i have my height
hello my fellow actors welcome to the
emotional scenes i've seen so many demo
pay off later the alternative to finding
that come up during escrow that make you
when you invest more that means more of
isn't just a memorization contest right
representatives for all the negotiations
this to happen because their voice is
if you're doing a ton and a ton of deals
and then just go like that back and
kind of how we sold it so fast and you
how this industry works
different ways you can do this and
i didn't pay the full 3000. i paid about
don't know what you're doing
subscribed to this channel and don't
they ended up
do all of these things that i had never
checking my availability i was actually
classes and childhood perfecting classes
crash at the next step in every arthur
twenty five thousand dollars and the
real estate is for sure
if you are in north america the two most
movie greenland
audition if you can get into an audition
move over three more tabs and the third
view making money
become an actor and because that's a
you're just eating by yourself and
up to the standard deduction each year
people that you normally would not get
on Facebook groups so lots of realtor
a full movie script can have 50 or more
really enjoy it so I think it's very
and then see if that works within your
onto my website or with the way that
and you'll likely need to at least share
fico score is made up of payment history
half but if i were to book a job
you're a musician they're the people who
products are the easiest way to save
to become eligible and then to join
room here to write 15 different
in the description below
audition for crying out loud so show
uh your down payment amount it'll also
need it what's the harm and bringing it
classes often offer
one role for simplicity let's say
to get it to the point where you will
takes to become a professional
obviously that's not everybody's career
that important
actually make money online because you
eventually they offered me a role
the enade ost best of the higher and
that i have used
advantages of having a high credit score
put a link to that resource list
means the agent gets
hours of life energy that we've given up
every time you audition
started shooting the rest of the show
this will show them your acting ability
you have a decent chance but if there
someone from out of state whereas if
platforms and
gonna be going over six steps that you
will be far more likely to buy the thing
and the reason I brought up the long
lend you this is really gonna factor
oftentimes they can only extend audition
cost and your savings will increase
share with a friend and also hit that
or not they should get a degree
I always bring a headshot to your
them all like and subscribe if you
experience and you don't have to wait
property as well as of course how to
benchpress because you know you got to
than our own
become a huge Disney star anyway so he
this course and so if your photographer
you have tons of cash to blow those look
one day
guidelines so they have to pay the
like the cost of incorporating if you
georgia that's the case for many many
overall stimulus of you know a real body
gonna turn acting from your hobby to
as you can
sirhants you have agents from selling
but again it's not about winning the
a script sections of a full script so a
are very into the environment and by an
starting with a blank resume the first
but i want to make sure that you know
agency ask your teacher or other
the building where we would be filming
if you have no experience at all stay
because we are always looking to hire
in to the film and television industry
won't look that great in five days this
to this channel to get more videos on
going to be 0
at the workplace
on the project and
to pay zero dollars for housing yes i
you can really see success so yeah
taking the class and investing in
or not you want to pay the fee every
experience in this video how do we start
where I'd set it before and I will run
the few weeks leading up to your exam
then you can look for private acting
up to one month to process for example
podcasts you know my friend Noah Kagan
renovations are useful make sure that
because you see something like 1000
didn't have to spend many many years
education out there and i think for most
and everything that works yeah
imagine if i were a lawyer and i gave
business is a part of having a great
have in order
is to prove to them that you already
people if you like real estate itself
boring video right but I just wanted you
recommend you take a voiceover class if
hard feelings and this at the very end
an agent
schedule I think one of the questions is
made up of medicare as well as social
travel to
co-star here in the
a self tape and it was almost all improv
and the callback was once again
think that your career is over
right well when we first met I believe I
in the way i can connect with you guys
to buy things that we find valuable and
we have four units total so i'm gonna
about personal finance investing in
never seen the client
for you to you know to see what are the
what can you do to stand out from the
talk about the business of acting
most money actually join a brokerage and
also be doing something while running
like how to set up your email list and
potentially creating an s corp you'll
week's video bye guys
taping let's get right to it
pretty important character in the movie
robbed and goes to this and other poems
takes a lot of time to maintain so
that's it for this video those were my
schedule I know you know if you really
ease the workload you don't have to
so that's why i consider it
couple of years just really don't think
the internet and those are your true
like new york or la or atlanta
you have to do is go on to facebook and
group of people
first-time test takers the passing rate
state questions and they also have this
could watch my course and how to edit
get your real estate license
cheating to the camera kind of goes hand
you don't know what's going behind the
becoming financially stable before
the acting career center here to help
industry rather than for consumption by
are the pages of the script associated
seven hundred dollars don't that scare
very big on mobility and resiliency in
like the top five percent of real estate
do choose a laminate luxury vinyl
all this time figuring it out you're
so that is a
movie credits right now i'm talking
if you like the video give me a thumbs
your credit score is really high you'll
so usually they'll take about one month
was in a position where i was still
myself just because i have a lot of
from everybody else because of my unique
just to the outcomes that you're looking
per year
from the other commercial because they
answer is
or 15-year course of the mortgage once
15.3 percent of your income is going
get it it went to somebody else right
you can see just how amazing this
so if you're interested in doing these
i'm gonna move on to whatever's next but
then wire car to the website will make I
beneficial techniques number five and
materials some free study exam questions
get our basic needs met
create your own stuff what would a
learn to enjoy the process the happier
what's the best place to live to pursue
as you progress in your career you might
single tuesday at noon eastern standard
and you're running your business and
won't have any clients and while you
I've learned since about why that
down here looking up your nose okay so
needed so what I would do is go on
casting directors and the director and
someone if you can listen and respond
my scenes were cut
out of town filming a movie
snowball rolling
live six days a week issue to do that
it is probably much more common for
10 plus years all right that's it for
rush for headshot how much is pretty
2.25 percent is huge so let's say that
just the same way as we are as actors
you're selling someone else's stuff but
have done have just been incredible for
understand that theater acting is
credit score without too much effort so
all the time because that's what they
amount of mailers each week track these
pretty much only pursuing the film and
for any particular casting there are
actual live instructor and you're going
when i lived in ohio i had a really hard
in spanish you would write that
now one more website that is very
particularly working on scenes i think
stop that
who submits to an agent is going to say
in in the area of your finances and just
having dialogue and
bucks and i'm going to be on tv this is
for a different role for that movie
i know you're one of the few that do
fits onto one page i want you to not do
and in those cases that character is
room and and said goodbye
there's so many people literally
description below
get your license in about three months
portfolio to show them they're not
an agent and one of the most important
who also happened to be the writer his
about sides in the intro to this video a
would stop all that and I would
sheet nobody knew that sean penn was
or they might be looking for just male
full extra day you can give yourself an

collectibles index funds bitcoin so many
features that change with your new by
it can be very complex and a lot of
let us change the mortgage info so you
this is directly from their website
post it on Instagram on on Facebook on
in this video we are going over eight
are watching my videos for the first
ten commandments of self taping did you
cost too much money but they are a bit
those are the lines that your character
start creating your own projects
another great benefit is that
this whole social media thing and that
and in California that's going to be
the home you can do an appraisal through
first time on camera and get in front of
for a long time the installation of the
and an actor's most important marketing
you got to understand that a demo reel
no matter where you live and besides
character is totally different than who
to be the principal place of business
states you can see that the average
your real estate license to help buy and
carbs and if you're someone who loves
with me at weddings i had a photo editor
i've personally applied the principles
really we want to be getting to the Holy

gonna be closer to the source of the
created on your own in which case you
for that period of time I've run through
continue pushing towards my goals while
later that i'd be able to go full time
habbid on ways to get and soul of the
place and you know it was built pretty
united states that represent actors for
a guy out for revenge like Steven Seagal
love you work with most hackers
all right so today's topic is what's the
this video
doing is that you're slowly
the location as a whole and i also
current resume you can see the standard
that said hey you have another audition
the uh social life that you'll have to
my commercial experience my commercial
train future doctors so
before we go there we need to talk about
the internet might vary from place to
can sell it like a million times without
coffee shop
30 seconds so look at what you do with
other options too before buying
times or even better they could say hey
something like a white or a light gray
and get feedback
handful of others as well
exactly what to say because this is a
yourself then you know the online class
the course study for however many hours
and then add this line and then
pros to getting it but you just have to
well you you can actually
listed here i've done more movies than
truthfully listen and respond that's the
recommend is just buying high quality
pushing yourself to a potential injury
audition that are just as significant
for a play or something like that and
now that male actor didn't do anything
louder than the reader who is the actor
when you have more money later on
real estate investing it's already a
there but there are also some really
television show i didn't end up getting
curls you're literally tearing the
no regrets of starting at the age that i
exactly what i did
this is something that you can start at
that there are actors that move to the
and they want you to pay them five
in the comments below
out of thousands of dollars by these
only goes through agencies and are not
non-union and a production can also be
there's nothing there then i will
pay for over the Internet and these are
return and you do this as
guys to be able to take the same skills
back in 2016 just me and my dog tofu the
you're going to be subject to capital
you're interested in learning my 10 step
what i would recommend is doing a scene

building that trust between you a great
shape or you're trying to eat healthier
based on the property type based on the

checking for all right that's it for
more comfortable you're gonna be and the
to subscribe to this channel to get more

once we arrived on set and this happens

like a house with let's say five
maybe a light gray for the walls and for
are getting paid so
television shows and you're wondering
that I don't have any valuable skills
it'll calculate your monthly loan
probably going to cost more money than
that an actor
look comfortable natural and real on
do that you know walking is great and 30
but it's the only thing that I've done
to the private mortgage insurance

and building a team of people around me
agent i grabbed my headshot and resume

you need to break into the film and
while it may seem vague and meaningless
times that
more focused on being a hot seat style
of real estate investing into your head
section is commercials
classes you really need to know how to
from the aesthetics to the price to the
are some factors that are out of our
your fault that it didn't work it's it's
12 commonly purchased items that you are
you you know you haven't given it enough
in the market because I was like twelve
week and post them to my channel alright

just want to say that there's definitely
great resource they know a ton of
said anything about shaq all i knew was
spending money at starbucks or other
spending some time here with me today
in order to work with an agent so i hope
playing field they don't
money come tax season
you're ready to perform
paper as the paper type and now click
your materials your attitude and

up paying more

water that's a dollar 22 cents
acting auditioning and career advice
to take a class learn your craft I can't
great for your career because not only
a wedding client once right and so um
on camera actor can do
agent salary in 2020 was nine thousand
everyone should try and overcome
you have the finances to do it you're
it was a real surprise when i showed up
technique that I'm going to share with
used in every other country so you'll
you're supposed to do
work that can back up
spending some time here with you today
principal performer
I would never have it in myself taped
and then you can get an agent you can
it looks looks like a nice dream and
people understand that there
their categories there are literally
in terms of life energy for example if
is totally fine because most phones have
beginners it's very visual very easy
for the scene framing refers to how much
telling you in this video of creating
arrange transactions between buyers and
your city or maybe in a city
approach our acting so back to the
people have because you just showed you
a callback is when a casting director
where you're going to have to consider
important role because the whole point
up but if you can create that routine of
there may come a time where if you
term is a breakdown now a breakdown can
which is quite expensive but it's more
your agent's contact information if you
biggest marketing tool that every actor
what is up you guys so I'm standing
which is like the most yellow light to
four on the best investments that i've
and spreads that payment over months and
a 25 meal if you spend that money right
cost some money in order to upload
significant other has a credit score of
and what's up
years you're gonna have to change them
hurt your chances of getting the part is
permeated within the pigments so yeah
if you let those doubts and insecurities
that will actually result in me getting
rid of your PMI payments once you reach
initiation fee
and how much you need to bring to the
get it is way too much to handle all
i do think there are a lot of people
it's because it extends much further
from actingcareercenter.com
rule Teresa 1 type an 8 and then 10 so
of the investment as well as how much
and if you can show an agent that you
website whether it's on
so that they can be the best that they
make us look like amateurs remember that
teach other beginners right now if
see if you can find someone else who is
not account for
all improv some of the questions were
able to say okay let me email you a link
sheet that's basically the 10 step
shape what I would do is just change out
gotta know your lines so you can please
book that particular audition it's not a
to make a career out of this
editor lily who currently edits all of
to make sure the name of the file has
channel got any questions
trust your gut when the role seems a
you have done your job
so maybe you're showing off the new
take it personally and definitely don't
entitled to take this right off a lot of
naysayers wrong
people in Alaska and people in Ethiopia
really terrible looking banner thing to
facebook groups the people there can
help tell their story - I didn't talk
well the way that I like to do it is now
you will never be caught without a
you want to start self taping your
that particular role but it's also an
scene of a simple conversation with
such as asana and notion that help you
really demoralizing and it's hard to
the actual credits
highs and lows and successes and
and i want to tell you guys that i don't
families that wanted to to make an offer
we've heard that let me tell you what a
reputation this this audience of people
food stay hydrated and
are they going to take care of the
great way
probably know someone that has a netflix
too big of a hassle but honestly you
to get started acting in your city right
um and let me know if you have any
owe a lot to house hacking here are the
because they don't want things
you need to change in order to keep
be dribbling a basketball and shooting
but it was a show about uh the mission
thumbs up and if you haven't already
because they want to have someone
auditions at home
actually afford to spend more money but
can watch the first two seasons of cobra
ask the actors to improvise some
round so as far as marketing channels
properties that need a little bit of
new condition so it just looks really
hey friends welcome back to the book
from work do we come home from our
major way that actors make money within
or off-white tiles with the gross grout
a PMI payment of 0.45 and then say
refers to your professional headshot
your business
that's a lot more like routine mobility
you're taking a 40 000
a lot of classes will allow you to audit
sunday to prep for the week that's
and graphic design and illustration and
their credit and look at their eviction
that and then just spending maybe a few
camera sees more of your reaction a self
two-way street
that movie and i look for my scenes and
and then once you do that then
or starting a new career path so i am
so every expense that we have everything
scenario for any type of real estate
or you are non-union in which case you
learning every time i'm on set right so
not book them which was true i did not
necessarily your most
criminal negligence if she starts trying
they decided to open up the role to
and you never know when that opportunity
you can create your own experience you
come from the on-camera world
no credits on your resume you have no
truly say just outsourcing and hiring
things you can do to automate your
first line that's in the script of the
one of my first movie auditions and I
let's say it's for burger king and then
that's very difficult i know of
in learning about my audition
may need to spend some money on some
yes 100 yes because the way you
became a teacher will experience what it
united states i think a little over half
time lose momentum and they take a long
part of human communication and thus it
paid to
i'll post below it shows you how you can
are more credits i just don't list
marketing there are a million different
if they interviewed a basketball player
currently lives in the city they don't
productivity course you've got this
sent that audition in and they saw you
can also lead to increased
my acting career regrets slash
um so figuring out where that tipping
when i first started in my career
to go to sleep so here's what I'll do I
star wars movies or whatever but those
put our billing
this is researchable and it's
your first try you definitely will need
they focused and on in character
sheet from
actually really minimize your tax
glossy white so it can pop and coming
a lot of money it's gonna really
and the other half are union states
into the audition room of a film and
think I mean that's really all I wanted
joining the sag-aftra
so here we write either lead supporting
there are versions of yoga that go into
don't have that full 20% down and like
commercial for your acting ability and
sure to get those reprinted on 8 by 10
somewhere between october 30th when i
agent on your side i certainly wouldn't
what i recommend for most people is just
step by step and section by section so
mobilize and build a resiliency in our
i've created a free audition
so because of that you see a lot of
be paying on the lower end of that
a lot of people gather them in the same
that happened
working after your feet and hearings
as actors now we finally have the
whenever your pay is based on commission
take a long time it's going to take
well that's exactly what we are going to
finding happiness in the pursuit
this is a main selling point of the
the same thing in fitness and health
smoothly so always ask them if they have
hotel while they're here
topic needs to be something i want to
without doing the things there that's
don't make that purchase i encourage you
maybe it says
behind the camera anything that you can
the glove and everything similarly let's
anything to start working with you i'm
industry my goal is to share with you
have to have this and it got to a point
included on different pages that her
and may have other perspectives
companies out there so whenever you're
highly recommend it because when you
this earth to go to work so we can make
lot of people
magic number and it's a win for the
now but make sure you check that link if
finance investing in entrepreneurship
of us can get on board with so let's
example you could build something like
my shopping cart and i was like
every single time that you have one and
us 10
mentioned even better I would love to
thus have the best opportunity to get
you think I'm gonna go and compare my
join the union because
your atm fees so definitely look for
then you also become eligible and then
in the description below they always run
even within the way of the sword coast
members of the mastermind has been
if you're in that less than 10 percent
you don't need to look at the script
not to get an agent the first step is
states it's going to cost under a
or small investment property and then
from my audition video next to a
might be a 10
but it is still only one piece of the
before starting your real estate journey
other role in this project that you're
haven't and I'll see you guys next time
actually go into a classroom drive there
and business project and many more will
the workouts at any time you know if you
can change the colors to whatever color
be scared as long as you do it right
millionaires say that real estate is the
longer than you expect but the more that
and you should have that money saved up
number one on my list why because we
set that I've been on and as an actor I
or hit television show that's kind of
credits to your resume and add footage
this also applies if you're a student
every single one of the 12 steps is
all i want to do is help you guys save
these student films
beginning of the day they'll hand you
resume the person that works at burger
it's just roll into your loan and you
younger then i highly encourage you to
for it when we're first getting started
much house
i did not even start this online
doing background work is can be valuable
met us at the curb he introduced himself
and there are so many different types of
university experts in 2018 agreed that
certain health risks dependent upon that
they now need to cast the movie right so
it's so much harder in my opinion to
on tv the more a commercial is run the
this industry but similar to
with them and any payments done on that
getting started and you don't have an
least 95
could pretty easily be done
so one way to get around all of that is
one day
work if there's a will there's a way
your business
or you could park an rv on your lot and
to the next section
high high income earners now the beauty
valuable tool to have the reason why you
blog post that I wrote accompanying this
that aspect because while there's ways
grow in my career and if i went on 20
example we have cold calling right
improvised scenario is to try to
for this audition so the callback was
accumulate more and more clutter the
biceps people just focus on the biceps
like get up on the chair and like film
have you have proper training you know
stocks with weeble and you'll get an
lower your interest rates going to be
the acting career center here to help
because the audition is not the only
alternatives that you could replace them
got started and i started at the age of
to type
that if you're trying to get an agent
sell as digital stuff because you
okay i know a lot of people are
every single word
actor in film and television with no
with the pandemic also if you bank with
you know watching tv it's not the best
repaint it it's gonna bring a whole new
a serious man with him comes strength arrives
doing it plus at the end we now have
my real estate courses
want to pursue an acting career
boost of about $175,000 so I want you
unless you can back it up with video
fifteen you know it's going to depend on
they say hey can I see you on your one
that night so that you can be on set
practicing keep learning and I look
of expenses related to home ownership
learning and i can't wait to see you on
better from a nutrient density
of college
to install a brand-new water heater and
photography business uh online courses
important part of the audition is still
wrong city i was too far away from where
correct answer which will lead to better
afford a more expensive home than if you
maybe five thousand dollars resurface
popular show I've ever worked on it's
that part and
like a like a slow push in for dramatic
by the time you guys see this video that
that was the time to do it so i feel
future union jobs now in a right to work
not living there you'll probably have to
because it's a good
and oftentimes those residual payments
cleveland ohio where i used to live is
so that
one thing that you'll notice is that for
should definitely go over to brilliant
area or or if I have pain if I have knee
time this is
annual fee for actors access
expectation that it might take some time
in my career too so those are a couple
you sign with is a reputable law ok guys
place outside at night or it's a you're
comes to our digital headshot
sitting down at a desk I mean I've seen
you don't make a lot of Commission but
as i mentioned so many times before in
really really hard to consistently book
word keeping all capitalization and
and this again happens for a lot of
here's how it works you're basically
out their demo reel
not going to be your forever home so
possibly but i somehow i doubt it
all of those actors that fit the
you're going to make a lot more money on
your first day on the job you probably
stated if you're buying a house that's
of and a software product online and
they're way ahead of themselves they
be replicated out in the real world now
important connections that you will ever
film credits right so we're just going
engine explodes this prevents you from
question price east side and the 500
like but i did purchase a website
source of income
find them on Amazon for like twenty five
is just the short description of each
no one right answer to this question now
into the film and television industry my
up that momentum
this video
director and if your headshot does not
those steps okay so let's start with an
their scenes cut from a movie or a
usually between twenty dollars and sixty
750 on your taxes the other method is
monetary costs
right so if you have nothing on your
very rare for me to
to gain experience you're going to get a
summary for you to go over as well what
character in the way that feels most
designer I then moved towards selling
real estate on Saturdays and Sundays you
sag after a website
the way i was created so differently
basically we are looking for properties
entrepreneurship thank you so much for
and then it was student films and indie
can't spell commercials all right so
investment like i got x number of
different from regular printer paper
putting down $100,000 that equates to
alright let's get back to it now one
you can create a free profile on actors
audition for it and
in one of them so this is you and you're
that your confidence doesn't come from
audition does guarantee that you won't
free to leave them down
a the actor gets a small percentage of
little girl was the very talented Navia
applies to you it'll have a really big
an equity member for theater that
they don't make that final decision so
union card
hundreds of dollars per year just simply
history and out of steam take art
helping you find auditions
happening in this scene you also get an
support your business for three to six
things change for example sometimes the
you can't afford to pay that much there
and television shows
bit lower then you'll be paying on the
definitely check out real estate express
camera you have a reader off camera
and the skills they need to stand out in
a great place to start is to search for
scene you've reacted to the explosion
property i knew that the renovations
during the commercial let me give you a
uh did all of our prep work before going
to submit for this audition
that while i might not be able to
will be an actual mark on the floor
and yes i get it headshots cost money
you don't know what to do next
stressor than it was like an enjoyment
rolled into the one hundred thousand
insurance payment so there's not that
one-off projects and also in commercials
they're going to be asking you to do all
are in your city or your state because
down we'll get the next one yeah and the
do prioritize union actors over nine
get signed by an agent so let's get
next week
simply because when i auditioned for it
which will waive all of the individual
catch a ball those are the things that
your career aspirations especially if
act and get better and improve your
and final column here is going to be the
you can change out the floors with lvp
you are taking your career seriously but
that's probably not the best use of
your PMI payment is only 0.55 percent
know that's why a network is so powerful
process that's helping me book many
just do that right now the only two
acting teacher and
is web series these are the types of
i know that many college acting programs
catastrophic happens like your car
you once you graduate high school there
and if meal planning is what works for
the top two he didn't get the part
see you in the next video
a link to it down in the description
what i would say is if you are in this
moving to a bigger production market
if you do all that and then you create
casting director that will also send
you can make an online class teaching
it's super blown out though so you
the paint and changing the paint is
a $30 per month virtual class we do six
shame yourself for not having the
part there was one actor who everybody
are that you have to pay for to start
from people
any actors career but don't forget to do
you read and you follow those
but nothing was scripted
okay so i think there are two big
thousands of dollars what i recommend is
i'm not saying to take advantage of that
i'll put a link to it in the description
an FHA loan then your credit score only
so how do we do that and that's where
research that on your own but i do know
I'm gonna be able to work out every
acting career center comp until next
initiation fee and that initiation fee
license to buy my own place because I
training and practice
out on your first handful of auditions
people have begun downsizing their homes
working on right now so earlier this
and way shape or phone so long i'm your
and i think this totally rings true to
investment that i've managed my business
to get into the whole real estate game
this is going to make us look like we
small market there might be a time where
and you want to spend time building up
your company
they'll make it right there
wilson porto
right there the third way to find
going to be on tv
these three websites have their
degree from college you would put
delivering the other lines who's
and even if you're not young you will
ratio and we can drag it to as big as we
this all adds to your experience as an
doubt myself because i know my
percent fica on that forty thousand
full-time job because
time is money on a movie or a television
insurance isn't a punishment for not
might have to wait seven or eight hours
interest rate it's gonna get higher and
happens all over the country there are
that you never knew existed
for me so the the 30 for 30 you you
playing those characters and if it
from that do have demo reels that they
the casting director recommending their
my channel to see more content just like
where they don't necessarily need to
as hard even after you do get an agent
to this channel to get more videos on
who's already dedicated to their career
our example let's only focus on one
wild bus schedule went online online
that you can find on your own
before going in now cold reads are not
so let's take a look at my answer right
to edit videos and a class on how to
at least look competent in basketball
you're in a more remote area you might
if you make um macrame things for people
then let me know down in the comments
lot of fantastic information that people
many factors but i'll tell you what in
human anymore
they select who they want to see
people in the United States we just
posted publicly so we're talking movies
that i don't wanna fight of making art
typically a casting director will reach
there's a lot that you do need to learn
jobs here in atlanta before i
well in right to work states
together like a well-oiled machine
to hit the next thing that's super super
could be doing dishes
lot of the behind the scenes in my
heard this from another casting director
important when trying to come up with a
of those and added better projects that
that up to you
determines so many different things for
not the only
think a solid color wall is the best
not going anywhere I'm staying right
first casting director is Sharon B Ali
the acting career center here to help
all of that ends up going to the
part I'm sure you've noticed by now that
hard to get into like harvard for
be a better option or even
available via zoom
me know down in the comments which one
in my business these are the things i
if this is your first time here make
business and not be caught up in a lot
you're interested in learning more I put
one was a deputy now for the sheriff's
i recommend you just go to google and do
and this goes back to the points that
so that you can learn that acting is not
which doctor are you going to take more
then maybe in upcoming episodes but
local facebook groups is that you can
HD cameras but if you are using your
recurring means you're in multiple
uniform now I'm not saying that the
once this pilot got picked up if it got
in my emails or on my blog and things
usually less than 10 percent of the
because we all start from somewhere my
right for this particular role but we
and staple it to the back when you are
where like if you sign up for all of
had i gone to la if anything it would
go full time so
you learn the skills you need to break
three thousand dollars you'll go through
the set
let's say 400 500 but now with that
one is really looking over shoulder all
they got to a point where you know
that week the more flexible you are with
for actors because
about this
right you got to think about this
audition on one hand and the world's
about it as the stepping stone to your
year i can't remember but recently i
looking into myself when it comes to
you know that doesn't mean that you
business side of acting a talent agent
willing to pay for if you're thinking
with it and sometimes people that are
is something that you're gonna do
the class you're learning a ton of stuff
probably do your interest rate
basic is selling other people's products
with their emotions and on impulse
experience and i should have done it for
you because you are standing out from
you have an apple vs. cake both are very
my rule of thumb is to generally avoid
this can be a great way to take your
really don't have experience in that
and money investment that i have made
pay as much it's the truth that theater
who is an actor and a personal trainer
before you get hired to be a
little bit about me and about my dog
mortgage payment is just going back into
somebody at an audition says here are
gonna fly here and then fly it and then
you need to continue to train and to
of those projects were
you're basically telling the world that
industry is by doing theater now
move around because you could easily
500 000 and you put a down payment of
window right here with these plantation
so originally they wanted me as the
backyard and just feels super spacious
gonna be talking about self taped
and in those instances they will post
in the commercials or
probably not gonna want to go all-out
the camera and act for the first time
every single actor that wants to
a reason to his first you need but
up to you as well
or the amount of money that you're
that jump and you feel like you're at
out the living room right here and then
uniform all the other actors myself
a duplex triplex or fourplex
the audition
scalable model because obviously my time
you are taking your career now i know
what you can do if you don't have too
we're going to talk a little bit today
hardwood floor they're gonna be a lot
hey curt give me your status hey shaq
acting classes
guys know that one in three americans
tipping point it's what's that point
the body every single body
i don't know what it's like in other
okay moving on to the last section which
we're not babysitters we are people who
these deals they are
director in the industry I've actually
channel to get more videos on acting
a really established entrepreneur now
think about money and leisure and
next thing you guys should definitely do
result getting actual clients and
ideas because they're also like amazing
helpful getting your real estate license
yesterday with a couple other actors and
i really want to encourage you to think
broken 22 bones I've separated his
they are finding local
but you can just go for something that's
already using one or you show it then
and i'd also love to talk to you guys
think we could greatly benefit from
how every audition is a win right and i
projects so if i'm producing a movie and
what I learned while working with two
about yourself question or a variation
you learn the skills you need to break
video today is I put together 20 of the
and multiply it by the percentage
and we can argue about it if you like
started taking acting classes
something they start wallowing around in
color lime green or red or a really
way you set a line it's like well let's
classes or
spaced their prep too far apart the
of people will then ask is well why
mean that we don't have to cook
be left justified it could be centered
focused on the
thing you want to do is go full time in
think that we want
i wouldn't expect to pay more than two
can to make yourself the best actor you
if you get an audition for the next
your time and i'll see you guys in the
situation where we go in person and
so fast you can't keep up with it so
how do you get your license and then how
agents and casting directors is our
excuse anymore at all if you want to
want to buy and normally for a house
probably around 75% of the people in the
actors first
how to answer it now I can't tell you
once you have a couple
feeling and how the body is moving and
there and says uh hi uh my name is John
going to make things work on all
put under twenty percent down for a
brand's all about and the whole vibe of
they've made the move here
they will want to hire
you you know started your journey as a
coming i should have addressed it in the
in the united states if you don't have
there's not a single person who imagine
thank you for sending me all of these
we're going to talk about all of those
plenty of money saved up when they move
likely you will see appreciation the
dollar amount
bones more than I have so not gonna work
get started the first technique is to
red question is what you get
three dollars a month of storage as well
do a cost segregation which is basically
personally like about myself and it was
that i never auditioned for when i
big three there are some other cities
long-term effect
if you did make sure to hit that like
eligible to join sag-aftra once you
for everyone and
is the cause or that is the result of
did see him
movie i learned
at 1 p.m.
to get checks
is one help you with and hold on good if
those of you that live overseas and got
they can't trust you to turn your
and so i would say that that mastermind
background is actually a great example
those practice exam questions that is
then you're going to have to find out
you know if you're spending more money
one actor or two actors per each
so don't get down on yourself if you
online these days
being on hold so definitely worth the
the slate is the part of your audition
normal computer paper either the next
you wouldn't put those on there that
don't feel safe or enjoying me wrong it
in the los angeles or new york markets
example you can afford a multi-unit
i said when we're investing in ourselves
all six of them cool but make sure
be posted publicly i would say 95
along the coast are scenes and the
pursuing my business
can do
alright that's it for this video
effort in I've also got online courses
you've got this huge audience that you
got on platforms like YouTube that I can
are all very cheap especially if you do
push forward anyway have confidence in
muscle fibers and unless they were a
my first time ever playing basketball in
multiple projects
hundred dollars especially
know Monday Wednesday Friday I know that
the job
potential money that can be made
credit card bill this can not only lead
everyone should take away from this
a really tight shot and you should know
represent actors
agents that put a lot of value
you started Buckingham Fitness and how
really interesting stuff in here about
and you lose a deal as a result these
and i had opportunities to make money
another reason
good man so my last letter my last
popular there's no shame to not put down
you have an s corp and you have a
save a lot of money in the long run
take note of all the key vocabulary for
you see in new york and the shows that
gonna work perfectly no one has to know
understand why these answers are the
time and you haven't waited until the
hey you guys and welcome back to my
when I was 12 years old I had this dream
to get acting experience
way to become eligible is to get
to join the union
is three thousand dollars now whether or
they just sit on the market for a long
one a photo printer two photo paper
hundreds of thousands of dollars now a
room second avoid showing desperation
so the people that make movies
specialist certification shirt so I'm a
person is gonna be running the lines
would basically undercut everyone else
and two hundred thousand dollars
going to be different for every single
that you want to buy a house and are
i highly highly encourage anyone who is
is a bunch of information associated
most actors are not rich and famous and
your nearest medical school and then
those traits quite yet and i feel like
the actual photo and there are things
haven't and that's just having an
thoughts and if i
read the books I recommend and then I
almost four years now I want to say is
online casting profiles
please show me your some of your prior
not caring about financial literacy not
with dialogue
manager you can use craigslist and you
they're running a business and they're
research all the big markets see what
forward because just because you didn't
you just give me a minute okay so I'm
casting director
to see how the whole casting process
learning investing in our skills and a
the wrong size paper it conveys the
go to find these auditions especially if
number six on the list is
right up there
get a tax deduction as i could
reality show rather than movie like the
did we met was it at Sunwest Park but we
gonna give you more light a better
languages of websites and then because I
because different areas have
book the part
you what this is again let's use the
and you are
make you a little bit of money at the
for your test and then you'll have to go
out game rom disney and with me every
hard and that you're using your costume
they do it on imdb so i just copied that
are not rich and famous
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
point is to where
thirdly she talks a lot about how
the entire thing i'll put a link to the
a new actor submission
we can put in the purchase price
post on public websites like actors
learn to enjoy the process this
it's like hey I'm super stressed I think
if you guys are donating it make sure to
some people think that getting an agent
one of those actors who gets to the new
that you've done those things and you
courses each being 45 hours you can
is one option a second option for acting
for today thanks for watching this video
their careers off the ground
hassle and they actually just go with an
hours you necessarily work this is one
get headshots and start submitting
you need to be prepared for the
business owners so the mastermind that i
makes us right for some parts and wrong
it's a union project that check's gonna
celebrity that might be involved in a
use all seven of these techniques to
bringing a headshot to your audition and
during the time that they wanted me to
in the theater realm is doing community
spending to acquire the things that we
now agents and managers do cost money
the truth is if you're just staying at
so similarly if you want your job to be
realtor comm all these sites are going
i can work on as many union projects as
investing out of state
you do the whole training right there in
network or streaming service moving on
twenty thousand dollars to
didn't hear
uh let say a disney movie once that
real estate when you're actually working
California the Department of real estate
afterwards and now we are finally ready
property and i've also been brokering
100% commission real estate brokerage we
there's of course some downsides and I
this project is not just a question to
few credits
at the first letter of each word what
know like what your intentions are the
money in the beginning but
which is 8 and a half by 11 as you can
once we start thinking of money as this
and to be stuck and not be able to
i head straight to the sales section if
it's kind of like the 48 hour film
many casting directors will hold
you disagree with what i have to say
with multiple people so that you get to
gonna be okay in there yeah that's great
ones is
you again so many opportunities for
of my friends dad's on to the web site
dollars back i truly do know like having
there's two sorts of people who will pay
personal life
treating your business
the week where you unsubscribe from my
documents because all of our photos are
real estate was appreciation and if you
absolutely incredible for me is my brand
and the answer is kind of the same i i
can this person afford to make these
buy insult property if you're really
big hollywood movies so today i want to
property do they have good ethics it's
good chunk of money number two is to
of course that is the photography and
downsides to just really make sure you
friends have told me that they've seen
would write
invest in real estate they need to buy a
happen another thing that i should
everyone needs to do i see too many
and invitations to maybe 50 or 100
reading these concise summaries of all
and then later that day i got an email
inspection report in your hands
10 or so years all right number five on
also think that the only way you can put
probably wasn't quite that bad but it
lot of us only use the printer to print
the international actors out there the
start out as an actor you don't have a
in case they need a character to be able
in our bodies throughout our four
or habits we want to be able to have as
it's very unlikely someone with no
hamstring and it broke my ischial
there's so much information
with it all and that you're burning
feeling about where you are
great if you are starting out yeah if
yourself it was one of the first videos
so i really want you to think about
join the union let me just give you an
is a right to work state or a union
advertisements and things like that
that they know
it's a lot of work you have to
i mean why put that burden on a brand
say like i started my business as a
it just isn't and and i understand if
an actor in film and tv so commercials
bathroom but it actually makes a lot of
all of those auditions back again
have to be training towards a specific
like that
taped auditions look and sound amazing
download this crop we'll save it to the
really get into this mindset before you
hey kurt give me a status hey shaq this
auditioned for this commercial with shaq
paperwork to store because everything is
this journey one thing that I'd really
and match the salary you need to make
home buying process one thing i want to
been the most popular video on this
you will have to go through the process
tons of windows overlooking the backyard
off of commission
story so props are not the main focus of
sections in bold
I would love it if you hit that like
lead or a supporting character
lead character and then
that promises that they can make you a
actors now the great thing is that we
talking about sag-aftra
there are tons of other loans out there
have the kitchen kind of blend in with
talent agents aren't going to sign
if you want to download my free audition
better than these agents then you can
auditioned for other roles on cobra kai
thing for a few years but I realized
and with equipment the cool thing is
is self-taping equipment the world of
everything or maybe you have no
having systems in place and streamlining
get professional headshots now I can't
all of this ends up happening in the
working on your craft and becoming the
happened to me
employees so commercials industrial
important role
me a role that ended up being the
okay those were 10 ways to gain
a lot of people will start out in
in the future is uh the cost of joining
twelve years having agreed within your
movies and shows are
actors access and casting networks
actors since you are a personal trainer
are my audition sites right here and
the last thing i want to say on this
to join
paste again so it doesn't take as long
conversation with a lot of people as
and you really know it and your activity
every month just to be working with them
would really think about what are some
keep going to acting class in your
account and then you can put your
i think atlanta is the best market
got my start on a website called get a
the seventh and final memorization
you started what if you started when you
impressed by your work in the class
is bigger pockets they have a website
first thing that anyone in the industry
casting directors will be having trouble
asked is Charlie how do you get your
that bus joint has been incredible as
then that really is a terrible way to
and career advice every single week
and they will be more likely to sign you
different varieties and if you don't
you can set up free accounts on both
convenience versus savings let me tell
into the film and television industry my
worth your performances father arthur
where you need to change some things
rest the more bedrooms the better your
should you join the union
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
and holds these competitions so like i
brands and that is a product conflict
it relates to our job
like there are some things i can talk
holding rental properties is that it
up to three thousand dollars now the
expenses you guys should be expensing
you guys found this video helpful
smart passive income and they've got a
experience all without moving
basically your scene partner for your
my resume directly on the back the
so if you have had a totally different
finances for example
and and seeing that on a resume so if
you don't have to get a full workout in
they just weren't prepared
will for sure help you on the test i
doesn't happen every day or even every
and the projects that are filming in
social gatherings or networking events
i absolutely love it it's such a
producer director all kinds of stuff in
to join the union nationally so you
at the acting studio
hard so you'll be
copy and paste it
sees of you so it's very important to
into the film and television industry
passing rates but I've heard that for
maybe uh an extra day but
hoops you could be just you could be
into the film and television industry
need to be able to perform immediately
it looks like this is the big kitchen
never been asked to perform a monologue
want to represent you or if we want to
having a full-time job and her business
the first time i was an extra in a
you do not need to cold call to generate
out those are
joining me here today if this is your
well put together book that when i read
scene they said okay now why don't you
truly believe
first email about that audition from my
a shout out i'd really appreciate it
type of work that an
but we can control how we come off as a
so it really is in your favor to have
interview them on my channel so that i
like a hundred different steps combined
we have to make as actors you got to be
years I've been following people like
have a callback sometimes a character
wonderful i love you that hold the host
unfortunately this doesn't happen in the
for their internal use and the most
use background work now the next section
and where you may or may not need to be
and let's say the director was greg
the best student
now during the audition process for this
but you want something that's going to
and i just feel like it's so much easier
audition but we're just go through the
films throughout the year
better experience for you anyways i hope
gonna have to do a little bit of work
means the more money you can invest and
to represent me for film and television
business that i do have a lot of people
on set so a big reason why this question
to invest my time in you but also if you
they're only getting auditions
started this isn't your demo reel for
is because of capital gains tax
other platforms as well other websites
unfortunately they've
first time here make sure to subscribe
and i'll go to that city and i'll work
all connected you know it's life is it
i'm on the road right now i'm actually
they're just going to move on they're
they could call you in for an audition
work it's actually really quite simple
locations may have different
and elizabeth's website templates as
that many people don't think about
we did some of the script but then we
status can refer
this channel
everything like that
i'm willing to pay for my own hotel when
write for instance big house theater or
then that can help you book the room at
in the next video
How to do it on
dollars i know some actors that have
that link right up there
out the door and they're going to give
congratulations second you're gonna have
basically taking the place
made at work and she says that for many
you tend to leave that blank and just
did and this actually is a lesson that i
things and the last thing i want you to
everyone to begin with and it was how I
it makes us feel like amateurs that
editing if you want you can check out my
just 30 minutes and these are workouts
background in a movie or you are an
nobody has that kind of power I've
but it doesn't look that great when you
you haven't shown me that
acting goals are
year in interest this is easily
learning and i hope to see you
I'm gonna share with you everything that
would have been thinking about these are
learned had to do with my audition when
gain acting experience you can actually
is your network industry where the more
wage but it also applies to people
getting your real estate license in my
you're getting a commission from each
are more sure that you want to become a
rates of appreciation in most parts of
fit the role and this happens all the
credit score so the higher credit score
or a big budget feature film nobody's
right up there now that you've prepared
okay next is just having too many
and because i haven't lived in every
one is really holding you accountable
so if dozens of agents all send all of
and television industry then you
breakdown i then send the headshot
that you want to change you know focus
is one line of a resume for the
really prioritize saving
just like this i make a ton of content
can also speak with a real estate agent
to be more mobile and I want to have
30 40 or more credits
and where to fill it out kitten mike rust and
where you live again if you don't live
many different cities like i mentioned
and they were frugal on pretty much
can just focus on what we've talked
work with a good buyer's agent now the
photos with just their phone right
many cities especially the bigger cities
as secret as possible because they don't
received all of those headshots resumes
like there's so many things that go into
close to a thousand auditions now
and happiness and he finds that at a
years into my acting career as a working
our four credits here we have star wars
made a final decision yet
I am g40 five five seven jpg well that
purchases that you make
different what works in one city might
write shoot direct edit and do our own
eligible to join sag-aftra if you've
industry that i have
different ethnicity than you or even a
now getting represented by an agency
shoulders up
and i was able to kind of push through
have 1 000.
told you about that client
pay and get your drink versus if you're
business and had so much
that I can play and pause with and the
this means that in total you are
go on an acting resume if you were
are out of our control as actors
for epson they were shooting
the same question i guarantee you that
agent the thing is most people will want
can get involved there may be social
school plays like these types of things
television show
less than 20% is the VA loan and the VA
first picture that people see of the
course after a couple seconds I
for someone that you trust to
are one you can book a principal role on
simply did not take enough practice
putting it into the house and when you
selling physical products
big lights on you
With it was time to phones with your
changing a couple lines too some of the
want to get a sense of your personality
can do is try and find a co-signer and
you might want to consider making a plan
what you study and how you study
know you got a look at it along this
I've done for the last eight hours or so
doesn't really work for places like
a little bit controversial but first
them a load of stuff for free and then
you've already started building your
it comes to investing you want to remove
okay so before you start thinking about
look it's difficult to get an agent it's
actor a third way to get experience
working on a television show
money and that's ultimately not very
over the internet and then you can sell
anything and what this does is it helps
probably going to consider
to make that happen and i say that fully
says and interviews that actually he
example the lead character
and make a plan before you make the jump
far from home then maybe la is a better
getting approved for loans now is it
the viewers attention on our face what
i'm really happy that i had to drive
make a movie or to make a television
now i'm not talking about being like a
like it's not directly tied to the
got a speeding ticket or your dog needs
that's really cool because i actually
the better so if i had bought in like a
someone who does know what they are
fulfillment curve starts to go downwards
there's just way too many temptations in
across the country
decided well this character doesn't
next up is focusing only on the present
you're not busy at all and it was like
auditions for
the things that i am great at so i did
whole nother thing so practice how to
isn't exactly Los Angeles when it comes
or if you got that from learning in a
bad right like that's only about twenty
if you want to learn more about those
can get involved in with acting
you have to do dust pose the
uh it's something that's broadcast on tv
dollars is not too bad especially if you
day are simply the pages of the script
just them moving a lot you absolutely
agents actually don't charge you any
it shows that you are working hard
this lets you compare between different
you're like okay I'm kind of on hold but
and just live the best light that you
jobs so
there are projects that are going to be
20 of the most common terms that you
from my agent and said
the scene that will require another
example let's say you're auditioning for
many changes
credits of on camera experience as well
sending those things out all the time so
and yet that movie was not filmed in
wealth to build your net worth and
in full transparency i do want you guys
curve is going but then one day we hit a
already started taking your real estate
your career step 4
subscribe to this channel if you haven't
digital products really are the way to
middle school high school
film and television there can be a lot
have to find that sustainability so when
student film or a web series and you
you on they get you off and your days
give just in the return of jackie and
for example if we're buying a fancy suit
gets paid out to you through a
however your net rental income after
knowing how my body works and how its
commercial for you and then we'll talk
much we get to sleep and so especially
get an offer accepted and
three the agent
them or change them fully and when you
outside of class let me say that again
there are a lot of ways around that so
difficult when you have an irregular
thousand dollars in credit debt and if
that they take a commission off of your
30 out of all of those
wearing my pain free performance
thumbs up and until next time keep
unless you already live in one of the
could just follow these three simple
your property
difference just remember to put it back
and i will try to answer as many of your
it's very similar to buying a car
if those things are filled out correctly
paycheck is coming from so we're always
twice a week thing cutting back on
take into consideration and that is if
it's 2716 square feet on a 17,000 400
snatched up very fast and that's why you
thumbs up and subscribe to this channel
doing without a talent agent
study for your exams and again those
auditioning remember that
and my experience both as a non-union
director asks you to slate your height
some dumbbells or I need to increase the
and it also affects whether or not it's
is it's going to calculate a bunch of
and their side hustles and if you're
be a
started with people in real life I
starting at the age of 26 i actually
network about a role that
the sustainability of our animals and so
into character and slide into another
mailing list of 20,000 people and now
booked a guest star
around town who
it's a lot easier than most people would
should turn up some acting studios in
huge benefit to having an agent because
accidentally let it slip
roughly one to three hundred dollars per
worth having let's say
or they'll be looking for a very
all these things already
can literally teach yourself anything
know so just find those good deals and
casting networks and backstage if you
process that i use for my own auditions
a look around your house
market with a ton of really valuable
speaking by themselves and there is no
also argue that body language is a huge
in this industry because it gives you
should always be looking out for the
preparation process that i use
of the way
i have zero doubt that this is what
acting industry no matter where you live
if you don't have this stuff it's going
created a free audit sheet that you can
workout that you're doing right and
what money actually is and there's a
we put this home on the market
you can write off any business expense
lot of money per month that isn't
accountable you're gonna have classmates
ton of content about personal finance
especially when you factor in the time
course that would not be good but
that shaq was
you can get your product in front of
to add to my tool belt
movies and television shows that we call
saying you need to have all of your
commercial or an industrial
an administrative assistant
resume and not
bold letters right at the top it could
never be in a situation where you're in
never ever pay an agent an upfront fee
also the director gave me some lines
is paying towards the principle of the
who are willing to work as hard as they
then using the actual expenses method is
could do a whole other video on what
that you should dress to suggest the
the casting director is gonna be pissed
spending some time here with me today
punctuation so a few years ago I was in
their movies throughout the year or
into two the first
groups you can start looking for
that helps you crop your headshots to
copy beforehand so let's say you go to
information in relation to work the way
something and people buy it from the app
barking it all the big dogs along the
eyeballs on me and therefore leading to
our life energy on this thing that we
sidenote the actress who played the
experience where you
walking dead arabic house with no
calculate the real cost of stuff
the casting director will then make
just getting their first agent getting
want so if we drag it all the way now we
that this type of production the action
websites and start submitting yourself
per year after working as a solo agent
whereas others you know I mean vegan
super important and so for me investing
and hopefully that time i will get to
another installment of the what I
than waiting out having house prices
comments below what your approach is to
but when when we see award-winning
about memorization techniques
the most easy to complete I've
photographer headshot photographer don't
want to find out about the 3430 they can
before you would do this for the entire
my groceries and I lunge you know to
it's really a way of the government
number two another reason why every
through this is a page and a half
mostly through the attention that I've
and artists out there you know I really
I'm sure most of you don't want to
work for
yes you could not make any money if you
and because of that it typically costs
you have so much freedom in your
putting it out on your website and all
paint over all that get rid of those
wanted a free gym membership I'll clean
songs of series the ocean you and some of
the question was
the most game-changing books i have read
the character the age range the
shows whether it's an in-person audition
this this is basically a cheat code a
right and debating back on that you know
be able to qualify for before you start
couple things clear one your headshot
them and i will see you guys in next
for you first things first you need to
their first auditions
and everything because I just wanted a
fault because it's a very good question
yet how do those actors make money in
make this example resume available on
guarantee you that if you focus on
seems very unlikely right and in many
dollars more per year right now rather
every different insurance provider is
gonna help you build the most equity for
Express was the cheapest option and was
be on time and I'm really great at
then while you are in your current
the means to an end
spending some time with you today if you
ask your teachers ask your fellow
with Sarah's character for audition
on how much you spend thanks guys for
you from channeling your energy
they stopped joking with each other and
part with their hard-earned cash to buy
pay agents of 100% we have training we
spending the full like however many
to have to move to one of those markets
from every other single person
three column formatting now the first
americans waste about 44 billion dollars
homes for other people you can also get
it down to your
you're in it for the long haul
then they said hey these things are
asked in commercial auditions so way
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
startup costs so to speak how much it
nutrition side of it too yeah so all of
for more advanced
the difference in delaying your
now sometimes they will ask you to say
your personal tax return or i've heard
oddly shaped here but I think it works
needed to be able to perform right away
well i've actually created a free
foundation of what real estate investing
need to learn how to play basketball
monologue practicing your accents
i have no regrets for coming to atlanta
then if you go closer and closer to my
as a working actor in the industry i
that means you're trying to pursue
you could be sabotaging your own chances
actor friends that live here
them out of your sole proprietorship
bodies you know you have to have rest
during tax season overall real estate is
that list leave me a comment down below
distracting so if you are using a
well that's the topic of this video hey
product even if that commercial isn't on
free content not really worrying about
practicable i don't know if that's real
your lines memorized and an audition if
all these different things that a lot of
mastermind that means that instead of
background work on your acting resume it
experiences but for me when i have
else and having them rehearse the lines
don't treat yourself now
particularly useful either recently or
probably shouldn't be to try and get
does not come with instructions well
and in my opinion far outweigh those
image on to crop alikom let it load and
perfectly their transition from joking
over 900
today i'm going to be sharing a story of
annual operating expenses so these are
sustainable for you you know your your
free audit cheat sheet that you can
the sides for Sarah they're saying here
now before we move on to the last two
afford what they're gonna do is they're
able to hear what their responses are to
you still got a really great training
have any questions please leave them
to its fullest capacity or at least in a
prospecting a lot you need to run ads
same question in the comments
where that market can no longer serve
four thirty which you mentioned earlier
you stay top of mind it's kind of like
you wear how much should you dress like
said earlier that the photo paper needs
a lot of people think so because that's
book either of those roles that i
to focus with the two of them it felt
the least amount of money I know lots of
super fun and i'm excited to share more
money and achieving financial
Candice were standing on their marks but
so make sure that you have training that
but for the most part you are allowed to
famous that is not something
commission so yeah that's pretty much
then getting that full-time job and
people can find it well number one i
acting career center.com
makes sense but
biggest ones here in the us
the acting career center here to help
those student films again
opinion it's a lot easier the class
me about yourself in an audition room so
lenders are taking on by lending you
every single role that needs to be cast
their top group their top choices
the acting career center here to help
those people doing the things that you
I'm based so if you're from somewhere
is have a home
moment before action was called before
you can use that loss to offset other
minor cosmetic fixes for example you can
that i have in my business and the time
get in front of someone face to face so
have your email address but you really
traditional you're paying taxes later on
contact information
over a thousand dollars per year when
take on the perspective of how much it's
potential work that was available to me
if it contributes to your business in
like 2700 K where it looked like an
that represents film and television
single week
deleted scenes you may see me a few more
share with you
with an hd camera these days
it's very possible that if i started at
comes in and asks us to add this line
the kitchen or in the living room you
I'm reading it out loud and I'm writing
are taking initiative
I'm speaking as a writer I would like my
for the next 30 years it can add between
professional actors understand that
did you know that just about every major
and have a vision have a goal
making millions of dollars a year
so high you're going to have all these
and the little girl would be sitting on
casting directors you'll get cast in
properties with just a real estate sales
that the larger your email is in general
to the niceties the positive
the main point for this one is you need
house is going to be a rental because
skill to have
to submit you to casting directors so
impacting all of these people that you
agent actually costs
some clips through so you can see what
in those cities are going to get
those two things
an acting career
great new sales agent training programs
they may put on plays in the class they
question is to use those facebook groups
are impulsive and when you look at
is pretty good amount of equity in a
for future projects future roles
um straight out of college so i kind of
and there are a lot of calculators out
great workout while enhancing your daily
what does an agent want to see when you
afternoon or whatever so right how can
this I'll provide some links to some
something like code school or code
meaning they were already a working
networks cost 25
i had never been in a tv show before
the same concepts will show up on your
point you are supercharging your
your actions and then finally end up at
your own
mastermind so with a hot seat style
information as i can
steps affect you
lie to you in that video all right let's
here's the work here's some examples of
won't last that long and in that case
gotten discounted classes or even free
hundreds of dollars sometimes over a
were all improvised
you have any questions about any of the
memorization technique you like the most
front of them and you're in their
you have consistent income coming in for
on nbc.com right now or on peacocktv.com
meaning people will buy um about three
amount of hours of instruction so here
smaller market and then at some point in
resources out there from YouTube to
absolutely necessary to do that in fact
experience the first thing that i want
exam and get your certificate
maybe I should have seen this coming
you can do the work yourself to create
a very similar story happen to me on
chase or wells fargo account if you do
new look those clothes will go on sale
light options those are way too blue
you want to go and find a local mortgage
to put a film together how to produce a
an agent
you in the next video peace
someone hasn't told us that we've
might make $0 some months you might make
careers in
harder because a lot of these streaming
the term side simply refers to pages of
awesome investment
make money in this industry and the
regional and local 40 plus credits all
lot of people want to skip acting
unfortunately i can't answer those
through real estate express they're
the project to the producers so that is
recommend that you do your own research
knows about this house is this gigantic
later on maybe you can do the other
something like that but
now anything four units or smaller is
but you got to go to pittsburgh in a
empathize with a lot of you on asleep
create an example acting resume
it's like trying to get admission to
on your actual course that's just the
director or a client might ask you tell
provide for themselves and for their
work their way up
can sign up for your exam depending on
to actually research the home buying
someone a little bit younger and i ended
courses whatever the problem is we still
made by investing their money and just
that you'll convert meaning p you know
acting world
get feedback and to know like what i
start auditioning for things without
is going to make the payments and is not
don't have another person to rehearse
understand that
be much higher at about 2.25 percent so
Rolodex of clients it's gonna be really
and pasting
of HTML and CSS by following random
your demo reel but you also get
enormous file sizes you don't need
and yeah sometimes you'll be auditioning
i'll put it this way so when you're a
you are looking at a state i definitely
that one they're not true they're
make a good
where i could audition unfortunately
opportunities in your area
lot of tempo work you know doing
about this relationship between money
psychologically am I am I just in a
rehearsed i was also told i needed to
person is in their sweet spot and they
countertops I've ever seen in the
start building up your own portfolio of
and that business card was printed on
and lots of people there for our like
theater either alone or in conjunction
you can do real estate part time i will
that will call this an audition script
column format here if you have a theater
the other option would be to go to a
say you're auditioning for a soldier it
solely on becoming a real estate agent
so many people helping her but she was
you simply because
on your side
this channel if you have any questions
they feel like they always have to go to
now it's it's clear that these are not
thumbs up
non-union productions ever again so you
reading self-improvement books and not
extremely good money back guarantee so
should actually be before finding a real
and then you put them up on youtube or
for you to go full time because the last
if you were not signed with them so now
from actingcareercenter.com
already a member of one of their sister
and fast way
in it's gonna be so exciting
you're like me and you don't like cold
which are the basic and a markup
groups in the Los Angeles Orange County
now another option to kind of save some
difference because the most important
value out of this video do me a favor
then we'll talk about how to join
have auditioned for theater and
on the board which is great really we
way to house hack and i know a lot of
we want to do is try to take some of
use most people are going to place a
have another resource on my website
won't go over in this video but to make
and this happened to me before so nah i
type of information that you will get
can immediately get into a major
basically there's only three ways three
requirement is that you actually do have
make sure to rate shop with different
non-union right here so remember this is
something new to learn an always room
a project do they still get paid and the
years if you had
survival jobs so how can we build an
challenging and shows you will never be
to Python and also their kind of
actors in your area and just to start a
confidence and knowing what to do next
audition for a movie especially
want to pursue
but we never actually got to be in the
about potentially joining my own
search for your city plus the word
have a couple
scenes should look especially these
after speaking with your lender and real
look stuff like that reeks of
we're just gonna be stagnant and so what
ratio is quite high
these lines five or ten times right
all these things come together and they
go by the first letter of each word now
can i do that from the u.s no i would
where the actor goes into the casting
loan is reserved for veterans and
want to help you
value over you as a person and a lot of
spending some time here with me today
conservative number if you invest that
you would put the name of the show and
by a professional headshot photographer
and understanding it but the as far as
doing the show for eight seasons and
important to hear those different
look every single agent when you submit
my business and things i'm working on
you're losing phantom money here's how
here they have a little spot where you
on this week i am launching
career advice
big bookshelves in your house and yet
for you to pay money to
you'll want it at the median level of
means that you can write off 5
tell me about your dog well guess what
already got to know me they already got
since you do know about the actor's
photography business to now being an
as a scene where you're the person on
through what it took to sell this house
own your instagram followers right
long term then it might make sense to
to see if it's going to be a good
in real estate
that you can get your hands on it at a
look i asked my agent this question
audition for
housing market collapse you know I don't
the paper size and matte or glossy photo
strongly prefer one finish over the
kind of sometimes we're really if that's
sandwiches okay so my actual response
non-union productions
and not be able to pay your bills so you
they wait until the last minute before
want to invest your time in and
when asked what do you do we don't say i
only 18 years old because i started my
on a certain date or something like that
should have done more theater i should
prop like that the action of painting
number that just says how much gravity's
specific type of business because i'm
photographer has to come out twice and
not you actually get those auditions is
books youtube you can pay for mentorship
start an acting career is with training
a sole proprietor
and until next time keep practicing keep
this there's a dude called Pat Flynn who
demo reel
it a thumbs up if you have any questions
through the pros and cons you went
corp is that you're actually
this you can get a lot of really great
now there are a few things i really love
audition for the movie won't back down
publicly on social media
every single time I might do one and if
in a big city look at your nearest big
i really wish that i could tell you you
access casting networks and backstage
my acting range yeah yeah like out for a
the point where they don't even look
it the key is just to be very flexible
growing your business or keep sustaining
get 29.5 000
get dimmers from most of them it's a
loan costs and that's gonna add up to no
either ordinary joe or dopesick or just
actually finding and then closing on a
auditions are self-taped these days
it's been a great part-time side hustle
channel if you have any questions leave
section should be television credits
you're working for your full-time job
of our life energy is devoted to our
probably because they had been working
because to be honest there's only a
interested in learning about my audition
really ensure that you have the
get in addition to what you got paid for
and knock it up with dan's kids in a
video then do me a favor and give it a
one side and then flip it over and print
here's a way that actors can make money
series regular lead supporting principal
so that in the future you'll get
prices and it's extremely convenient
you're not seeing any of those auditions
out two more things that I did in that
challenge our brains
highest grade internet is just going to
step number three is to learn how the
talk about what renovations you can do
this type of style so you're gonna have
know my mastermind coach or the other
lots of first-time homebuyers might not
they hired me based on what they saw
what I'll work on the weekends whatever
more modern colors so baby go for
dress pants well those clothes can
week well in a week that's 35
working on that show because they are
finding your first tenant and the same
anymore so I transitioned out of it but
your business and be super excited about
they're gonna be on your side with a
create your own film on a weekend
i've talked about this before how
after work hours or on your days off
our team so if you guys found this video
you one really good way to get started
are gonna be better for you they're
and who knows maybe this is going to be
explosion is your eyeline for that so
this spot by just reviewing his initial
yeah just don't be afraid to buy
question but my advice is to suggest the
is that there is a minimum base pay that
incredible opportunities that i would
below and let me know which approach you
how much life energy we're actually
for that one part it is very common for
right before my last breath and then I'm
vertically turn your foot turn your
haven't already please subscribe to this
worth pursuing is ever easy like they
went smoothly even though they had so
shows and that's because
training what else can you do
their business as a side hustle
common these days I typically take 80%
now self tapes are becoming much more
the crowd
honest most of the information found in
places that you know I might not focus
old-school like oak cabinets paint them
comprehensive guide to navigating the
toilet so if you want to see that but
opportunities available
feel your body
hair color and eye color are pretty
it really blows my mind to see how far
offering some kind of service and you're
it like people are expecting you to sell
channel to get more videos on acting
friend who has a self-taping setup
considerations when you're deciding to
see that you've been taking classes they
go to your website they can go to the
working on right now
but that's only been the past few years
when you are non-union but whether or
commandments self taping commandment
template from elizabeth because um i
much money to do so okay second on my
even know what would happen yeah I just
afraid that they they're gonna let
sell the house you're gonna get that
recommend taking an online class if that
this was actually the second time that i
this started thirteen years ago when I
ton of their income via commercials and
set one day
piece uh to see your acting ability and
set that vision and let that inspire you
casting director
practice practice practice your
up just keep looking keep looking and
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
it might seem like a little bit of a
I'll be talking about how to deal with
other the next day we're home the entire
espn and maybe
shouldn't have been caught off guard and
mortgage payments they can jump into a
listen these people have been sitting in
000 after that it drops down to 2.9
needs to be about 500 those are
extremely low
casting directors say no absolutely not
we're going to talk about
because i didn't have the mental
money by actually performing
actor who wants to break into the film
that you may have to incur
see what products you buy and instead of
but also potentially in residuals years
doing something else while doing that
things that we just talked about and
there is absolutely no excuse to turn an
in the beginning well
that you are looking at now when you're
feel free to drop a comment i would love
and always have a rental agreement in
different things that i offer like what
film and TV auditions and one for
decide song you make sweet the sting
why do you need an agent then if you're
vacation whenever you want you can
you do in that situation right so don't
your attitude if you present yourself in
this video because firstly more people
and create your own acting resume off of
can to improve your craft
people either for family reasons or
it's on your casting profiles or it's on
they tell you you need to be off-book
that you can bring to the table that i
lenders as long as you have above a 740
cut from the movie and you only got to
much routine as possible however in the
angeles lakers
photo paper because I can print on both
very first one so the first thing that i
want your business card to stand out
day job like i was when i first started
long-term rental for a flip or just for
in your income this literally happened
500 600 or more per month but
if it's your first time here make sure
getting started
a few years ago and that's on your
acting coaches hey I I want you to
main topic is
focused around us bringing projects that
the grand scheme of things is not bad at
of acting out your shoulder pain or
a baseball player or a softball player
here they're more sliding closets so a
and that is booking the room let me
and i'm excited to welcome more of you
you want to become a real estate
two years ago I had a streak of 37
sag-aftra well
now one more thing that i want to
knowledge to get through real estate
as well but i think those three are
were doing it myself i'd probably keep
i'm just excited for you and if you're
three learn the business now one of the
so where should we start well if you're
so understand that those are some costs
advice every single week well
time this is just a little trick that
because each state is going to have
how the casting process works
to create my brand i did create my brand
so that you'll be sent an email
booked a role on stranger things and you
should go full time and all of that so
for many other projects uh when i
see success a lot quicker the next thing
working on
done plays since they were very young
couple of reasons number one
things in terms of opportunity cost so
on my project
until next time keep practicing keep
interesting just a smile alone will
each and every transaction so yeah let's
about where else you should be seeking
in order for them to be allowed to work
on scenes together that's such an
if this is your first time here make
it's really hard to say for any specific
it's a really big time commitment and it
you have representation
getting a lot of feedback from the other
now once you've worked on your first
different gender than you this happens
when that movie comes out and i go watch
the best case scenario is when you have
and have everybody read for that role
ergonomic handle or the Badger hair
our time is is limited and so if you
going to have some type of social media
hospitals hire people who have already
content i watch is
the industry so make sure you find
already and until next time keep
and energized ready for a great evening
is their headshot your headshot is the
passive income i've joined at this point
control over it's important to
brings a smile to my face and I I just
go check out that video but maybe
within the story along with the other
possible you know we want to have our
through college
no agent no headshot no resume you're
another round of auditions
absolutely the best way that you can
for money and this question is
as an s corp for tax purposes anytime
but for me for the way I want to run my
the actors with
set and hey there was sean penn
get an offer accepted
this as opposed to weight loss think
that you can correct right now without
bachelor's and a master's degree
services are probably
pure color it's gonna make the
mastermind members and that like has
buy the special edition of your album if
my actual booking when did i find out
one really great way to do so is to
they not only do they want to see you
to acting opportunities I was extremely
at the beginning of our lives more
you don't want to be uploading a
offers that you submit on homes that you
you learn the skills you need to break
little bit about
so if you've been an extra in a movie i
youtube land you can check me out on
don't know what we're doing it's gonna
good to be prepared because without the
go to a photography student they may
something that I think would personally
your scene partner for your audition the
completely an utterly life-changing when
you may be allowed to get those
know but at the end of the day it comes
better be sure
nights when he kissed you audition free
matter too much and what you can do is
other roles on the show which is exactly
all right we've all heard it's normal
to a happy meaningful and fulfilled life
and that's the first thing that they ask
so much for watching i hope you guys
when you look at the science of it you
what's up you guys Charlie here so today
exam once your application goes through
during your audition they are basically
fourth tax strategy is to definitely
people so that you know the people who
hospitals don't turn people into doctors
on zoom unfortunately i was not
friends and stuff you just need to put
dollar pie now one very important part
and it doesn't have to be long it only
i like having it on the left underneath
casting websites
during that month you need to study
directors are only going to watch about
as actors we really only know about the
it's really important to know the
thinking hey I should sell my house or
with one bathroom and then upstairs
actors let's talk about saving some time
filmmakers in your area once you join
learn about real estate investing you'll
proxy for life energy we can start to
you know we might be very busy theater
teamwork that's why i loved studying the
sure I had them down when one of the
excited to be talking about something I
important decision it's a big decision
i'm too old to be doing this i'm not
going to be a ton of results so here in
the third thing you guys have to know is
and they give you the lines right there
to actually go into a classroom every
types of projects that you are allowed
with you guys next time bye guys
buying a house here in the United States
of shooting a short film you could just
once that system is in place once that
show or commercial the days that i work
starting today and you can catch my
is to create your own content
is demo reel editing now when you first
if you're getting value out of this
mistake number one not naming the file
you're putting in the put on the MLS
shared and spoiled on social media
percent is actually a really good
moving on to step five step five is now
take a lot of write-offs that you
represent that fit
and then I'll go do whatever I need to
spending your money
characters lines beforehand you go in
estate investing as a living see their
the next thing we're going to talk about
to whether or not you have your lines
los angeles or new york
on be more customized the house the
questions then are you know because as
with how the traditional casting process
of finding trying to figure out how i'm
then maybe you can look for acting
which is one of the most important books
that's doing all the types of projects
people you how the work i could you
mention is that the vast majority of
forth all the way down through the
video please give it a thumbs up
and resume this one's pretty
in that market and a lot of times those
relationship for it's an opportunity to
the computer like coding and websites
are said in a commercial so if someone
or you can go grocery shopping and make
exceptions that don't apply to that rule
Brandon anywhere and then if you could
hold it steady for your audition it's
one and your two is your end mark so if
from the crowd the third way to
if you're going through the hassle of
talking more about spending money and
give you auditions to make you do this
then brings back
a chance to look at this last night can
practicing keep
first speaking role in a major movie as
need at least one or the
Tina latte venti I don't know I don't go
do you have to live in los angeles or
average it's about 48 hours now you
step seven is actually doing the
I think both of us have been there where
money on paper you're not actually
like a sounding board for ideas i have
about that in the description below okay
lot of people this is too much of a
here's the thing shaq was there that day
generic brand products and yeah
looking for
and then what things you should be
i really encourage you to do that read
if you are interested and you want to
sort of teaches you the the bare bones
the same director the same company was
if you're young get your first credit
kinds of different office products
auditioning is a completely separate
film and television
and give it a like alright moving on the
auditions for all kinds of opportunities
getting started and you don't book your
way for anyone
of the population is gonna know which
didn't like it give me a thumbs down
that I didn't take that role as tough of
submit to an agent actually end up
don't have to follow any of those rules
your life so that's why it's so
dollar loan
business or maybe you're having doubts
but don't underestimate the power of a
for for the rest of my life
person right
you wanted to write now you could start
there were not many movies being made in
nine-to-five job so if we're leaving the
the science behind it or the the
starbucks that's definitely something
about how to join because the ways to
every single
of the day-to-day tasks so my team has
payment is going to come out to around
actor so
really this is the exact playbook would
there's plenty of stuff that you should
those wrinkles self stamping commandment
spending some time here with me today if
oh i want to see this person audition
and why is that it's because
casting director will probably say hey
in order to support their acting career
with an fha or a conventional loan
don't want to go that way so hey it's no
make more money by outsourcing because
many years to see success in real estate
it's actually due because you don't know
good to have a safety net because
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
YouTube tutorials or by paying for
haven't already please subscribe to this
teaching you things on the mastermind
really interesting to see how loose and
where they say this is the best or this
who had already auditioned for the other
watching this video either has a bank of
officers desk that I would be sitting at
the correct size paper if we don't our
help me memorize my lines is to record
it wisely if you're too young to have
questions because i've never lived in
agents are looking for people who are
goes for all future tenants too this
in which case this will be netflix
forcing people to join
director even reached out after he said
disagree let me know in the comments
right so I would be spending a lot more
right you want to have a
movie can be 30 pages 50 pages 100 pages
estate course
single week now before we get into
stand out when you're submitted among
you gotta think of it this way mortgage
the even thing about that that means
in this video before getting started so
a half by 11 you can see that I wouldn't
and that you already have been working
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
it's going to give you the greatest
coder com where you know people would
audition so you have to have a headshot
set all day some days we're working our
that is relocation costs when you move
and there are lots of details that i
is also really great because it teaches
workshops and classes
that fifteen point three percent tax
someone who has made that happen
we're in the middle of the pandemic so
the comments if you have any follow-up
a good and a bad tenant is
number one is to follow the audition
non-union project or the performer is
is also acting and a lot of the people
at the very end of your preparation
some tips that I kind of learned
my name is kurt yu honored to be
before and I thought for some reason she
professional before you get someone to
audition even if they say they don't
chase your dreams of doing it just go
when you're doing this they're not
in a community lower budget you're
recommendations or visit the acting
and he tells me hey they actually want
i was sitting with a bride and groom
quite hard selling a physical product
don't already have one let's get started
that you shoot with
home now i'm not saying like never get
simply having an llc means you're still
crucial things you need to know before
small town you may not be able to find
your own that's because talent agencies
to subscribe to this channel if you
touch on i have a lot of independent
mistakes that have nothing to do with
trying to buy a $500,000 home that means
someone tells you that they're a talent
either but i booked the room again so
want to make sure that it's a good deal
do a consultation first just first and
it would be probably going overboard to
relationships that are built on trust
stimulus is or stimuli and then also you
down and leaning forward to talk to the
considered pretty low scores so that's
will take this seriously and that you
can help with sound help with lighting
we need to do is to load the printer
monologues for sure
characters and then perform that scene
that have paid great wages that have
in making their film you get to learn so
but ask yourself this what in life
this is something that some productions
not saying all non-union productions are
a class for free
days you might be meeting new people
I would have had when I first got
of me in person or virtually you know
99 of people just don't do these things
skill that people are willing to pay for
halfway memorized where you're not
investors but the loan terms are way
anything else i can change getting new
that you could sell you could try
your own demo reel whether it's doing it
auditions has moved heavily towards
and to continue to submit yourself on
flush so they don't really stick out
practicing the intent and the
this one was going to be
to it right
might want to change and have almost
mark and then you're gonna do all of
of experience in acting the second way
so you'll save lots of time and money on
to do now if your house is worth
completely in this case fifteen point
think you can do it part-time but if you
their website and their phone number and
where you can connect with people and
deposit 100 or more and those four free
out now if you're still in high school
not be a featured role in your auditions
ideally we want the ongoing time
throughout the process that I wanted to
need to do what everyone else is doing
stuff that we do for television because
the female deputy and the male actor
reasonably straightforward to develop
gonna dive into today i'm very excited
think most of you guys are going to go
a scene partner and then learn how to do
professionally so that's what you need
i mean a city or a state where there is
well i'm not talking about big hollywood
you give them a hundred you keep 900.
noticed in the comments of that previous
don't know 1% 2% 3% Commission on that
they are not too customized or too
bit more
your agent will be sending you
my career and that is act
certain areas perhaps I work out in this
was totally caught off guard by it the
myself a different deadline than the
blockbuster movies and they're not major
can get that by going to that link right
a lot of companies will put multiple
very common in the industry in the last
and it's just so much easier in my
on-camera classes start recording
like it's gonna make those offers a lot
actually had a pre open house that was
and got my license from real estate
personal reach what one day someone in
important we mentioned earlier that only
can mention all of them here
mortgage that is considered 80% LTV loan
playing in the nba so
today is going to be a really fun video
one is unexpected vacancies can you
in this case a house that's worth
will just be less stressful and most
getting paid for it nobody's asking them
this answering when answering tour took
and they have that training
lot of
up if you haven't already
a mentor like that since i know it can
remember they represent an
if you're thinking about starting an
energy will be contagious and will get
it's the name of the film
selling merch but it's it's kind of hard
someone should be making for a
going to that link right there alright
make money online magnifies a lot
independent film
where all their money has gone think
even though I live in Ohio I've been
but you might not like the way I coach
absolutely 100
50 off now the first thing i do when i
enjoyed the video make sure to hit that
myself this is the house that my sister
in order to be able to go full time so
something like that whereas with this
even if it's indirectly they may not
acting gigs available the vast
for the real estate exam is to just do a
professionalism that's because this is
have when you're trying to buy a house
fraction of the actual number of paid
the time and find the ways to fit health
this character okay so we're not
my first audition for the commercial on
computer needs to be that same aspect
video it's perfectly fine to shoot in
this is rolled into the value of the
whereas if you move to a market like
to read as well because they want to get
want to on set they don't have to follow
or the year that you got it and then the
okay got it let's do it and then we did
making instead you want to track the
question because
is especially true in competitive
and this encourages us to think about
about yourself in an audition all right
way not only because it can't be taken
watching my channel are not really
auditions with your phone
so you got to make sure your headshot is
irregular daily routines because actors
new marvel movie they won't tell you
all these auditions and I didn't book a
november 6th so a week after
you to come up with a plan on how to
that the cost of borrowing money is
back of your headshot now one more thing
may seem high to you um but you got to
and that they are really serious about
and he was an enormous human being oh i
needless to say I did not book the job
the vast majority of those are not
all the content by the way if you guys
this long term capital gains tax is
breakdown so if i'm an agent i get that
because the more eyes you get on the
cesar hobby and go and apply now if ever
share with you the story
audition and his call back
cheat sheet that you can download by
rent and you can do this by looking on
and to redo it and find out but a lot of
as you walk from the living room here
important whether it's you know from
a background actor
characters and that's why we offered you
lines I lines simply refers to where
maybe I just do you know five minutes on
stand-in work on a project and also
pre-approval letter with a certain
gonna walk into frame and then I'm gonna
ton of questions hopefully you've taken
a shoot or something on the weekends but
if you took classes in a in an acting
only a small
to buy an email can be an incredible way
can because if you're a beginner you can
in order to study for the actual state
thing i do want to point out is i would
about how much nicer it'd be for you to
upper and ultra high net worth bracket
improvement product and as I walked into
necessarily as much there's less
of enough we then start to just
trader joe's that don't really have
investment that is hard to learn and get
which can come in really handy sometimes
keep practicing keep learning and i hope
wagon do a couple squats you know you
it's probably worth secondly you could
see more content just like this i make a
won't tell you what it is
into this career but oftentimes most
these practice exams where they have
powerful resources free education
obviously this isn't an overnight thing
join may change in the future
through these online activities through
full-time job
say that the things that we value our
collection of projects that i've worked
figure out what exactly is
those types of things are great to start
these certain exams and so we charge
so those brokerages could be really
stupid and keep
important for an actor
non-union projects
to not feel like you're just stuck and
flexibility so that you know I can be
and improvise this scene so you're kind
much you spend in your personal life
i booked through my first agency in ohio
if an actor gets a call back that means
don't think about and that is being a
once that season's over or you can
I probably start to contract these jobs
different things people are looking for
that's how you join the union and stay
for under 20% down if you think that you
that makes us doubt ourselves or if
get a mater port 3d tour done any
important for example it determines who
sore I didn't get a good workout or no
audition was
and now the only light that's on is the
different categories and they have
are for some reason still way too big to
union member you can never work on
generational wealth you can have cash
facebook groups for your particular town
wow that was a professional actor then
money and automatically invest it when
these are
a script but they told me this is a
vaughn's or ralph's or albertsons but it
director is sitting on the desk
school play to get involved in drama
agent you also get to meet a lot of
la for my acting career absolutely not
that is and how that's helping people
to get into movies and tv shows because
any questions leave them in the comments
for building
them to do work
common example is a training video
then how much should that fund be that's
and in order to represent an actor i
think about product-based businesses
recommend you research universities and
on it's really holding you down once you
fast seven different ways now these are
know you're gonna have some questions so
there are currently three ways to become
walk over and just address the patient
city and see if there are opportunities
so cast yourself create your own content
probably a little bit easier to become
and I ask you to email me your headshot
the union is and
only talking today about what the
people in the industry especially people
we don't list the directors and that's
you know I didn't lose weight today I
career there's going to come a time
is you want to have a small nest egg
why a demo reel is so important for
using props unless I really feel like
information and have it stick in your
carriers for my car
of keeping it so for example this
so fast and yeah I just hope that all of
small town there are zero
initiation fee to join the union
business more
things automated but because you already
you're gonna need it and it can be a
actions that actually drive the number
learning how to act
that if you're guilty of them you can
so so I think this video what I wanted
people that live in another country but
where the film and television production
descriptions about these three ways
and that's only 12 seconds of work but
going on so not only are you getting
about how i prepare for my auditions
now a home inspection generally costs
a self tape as a demo rather when you
you add these two things up you're gonna
this platform and they've all been very
online without me having to put any more
today in fact
union to follow all of those guidelines
that was pretty solid alternatively and
after only doing it for a couple years
eyeline so for example let's say there
one go right ahead there's a private
in real estate there are a few things
to someone that actually can't afford it
over this how can that be our job so our
below market if you price up a low
numbers for any deal that you're
the website about exactly what that
accountant and this
right so for this particular role they
ended up being offered and then they
to try to take pictures
so right now let's assume that you
how to get an agent for acting
after television would be film
isn't high enough to actually get
really incredible and so beneficial to
now i did this with my first
and it's used for business
doing similar things to you and who
back in 2011 three years after i started
other people's projects and that's to
about it afterwards
if the house is near you then maybe you
then i've created a free audition cheat
and give it a thumbs up all right let's
Allison Janney has talked about using
are in california and you are looking
accessible if you want to join me in
full-time now if you're not even sure if
your career without a talent agent is
comm you can find the link in the
that's the first thing that
the scene again and everybody did it
that's because that's where 99 of the
money to start working with you
if they wanted to go to Tyler Buckingham
making money in a different way i
live instructor might be better because
bluish light it's more like something
with as much potential as possible to
honestly the best place that I'd
now sending all of the actors they
offer the classes those those
when you decide to join the union that's
past him
classes for cheaper than that
are taking their career seriously
debate over whether or not to put your
want to do is you want to be top of mind
down below but yeah like i was saying a
and every word and when you go through
productions are not going to pay
now step number six is to create your
receipts super fast it's unbelievable
anymore like are those like sentence
actual food itself so like when you know
whenever you have some free time a
brilliant is by asking ourselves three
see every single pore in your audition
audition that's because I don't want
something you should think about when
you're trying to buy bigger and bigger
hard her business was growing so fast
television shows right there are
everything and then turn off the lights
then the first thing that she looks at
having more bedrooms and you need to be
financial education
union background vouchers again check
money saved up beyond that actual
whole tour hope guys like seeing the
and then finally we'll talk about the
we can think of money as our life energy
committed to this
why I recommend for most people with a
these in my career when i first started
there are so many different tax
payment is to offset the risk that these
these are the websites that industry
start getting decent reviews and you
what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
you have also give this video a thumbs
are at that point in your career where
spending money like you're rich
first step is learning how to act
are a little bit more flexible in the
not 100
that the director can mold and you know
in some sort of sports or
it works basically let's say you guys
show them how well the best way to show
going on when it comes to especially
on agents and headshot photographers and
managers also make anywhere between a 10
corporate clients that are looking to
camcorder a DSLR I don't care if you are
hook that you're launching every time
into the film and television industry
go through you'll get scheduled a date
then you know you might as well do it
part if there are three actors
prior but instead of again instead of
with your business expenses but then you
on an inexperienced actor might say oh
certain day from let's say like 5:00
a lot of community theater most of it is
happiness those are the things that lead
opportunity to not only work on set but
want to watch me anywhere other than
your social media channels another thing
it also shows them that you understand
fixed price or if you don't want to do
something with your phone film a scene
for a television show the final decision
haven't already remember to subscribe to
building your network your entire career
to be so happy that you started today
virtual and email has been very
wanted to be super cool and therefore
which are very similar to the actual
channel we're getting really close to
would be a good idea to wear like an
we've seen prices skyrocket in the last
that i think a lot of you guys need to
a handy tool I like to call the internet
refusal and then finally
little bit but i also understood that
just the first letter of each word to
is a marathon not a sprint you've
you begin to build this character from
are the professionals that you should
uh fit into a demo reel then you may end
and how your audition kind of fits into
it's like hey that's awesome you know
dollars of expenses this means that your
can connect the TV and just have it
decided that I wanted to be a super nerd
motivations and the relationships that's
second of all if you're interested in
trying to become a real estate agent I
call back
anymore so that is the biggest
is a college basketball player
online you could very easily sign up to
acting career well you'll find about 500
practicing keep learning and I hope to
people off the street with no experience
making movies where it's just the people
can't do that because it's a title of a
television side of an acting career
think about it a TV show or a movie is
in the united states movies and tv shows
i'm able to afford to live
the us and i'm sure in many other
allowed me to grow so much is my team of
to it down in the description below but
like six months from now or a year from
to mailing list whatever you want but
i'll see you guys in the next video
way too fast now i know when you sign up
you will sell to over and over again
load of materials that teach you the ins
to pay the difference so it's not like
injuries aren't fun they're not I've
see they want to get an idea of what
for their online course on learning
well so
channel I make a lot of videos about a
at and figure out what you need to do
correct do the snuff and you'll know all
if you're an actor and you don't have an
it's a real business card and it's got
laws it's definitely a ton of
about my thoughts on that and when you
when i was signing up for internet
not diets because you should be eating
there's also productivity apps
you should be paying who's legitimate
few free hours during the day you can
whistling and ends with you some
other things in order for the agent to
so if you happen to have the skill or
not necessarily a small city it's one of
okay I want to move somewhere then
your money or your life by vikki robbins
different city
then there's also people that don't want
when it came time for them to cast
self tape style demo reel and then
before since it's so easy for people to
route routine routinize habitual eyes
effectively remember that
but in my experience in my 12 years as
the next really important thing and this
i want
then together were a team and we go
agents don't turn people into actors the
that link is also in the description
lifesaver so grab a folder put some
they were very fast and very efficient
and try to get auditions and audition
15 or 20 percent depending on your
it shows us that you can cry and it
and their footage that you can add to
remembered it and we got through the
that morning
don't pay for it directly rather you
having a strong pre-approval letter that
investing in entrepreneurship so that's
prepare for buying your first home
ago that was someone 10 years into his
reason why I don't like that is because
a year and so ultimately as robin says
that you can remember all this
so this is where you would put those
finance I make videos about this every
something that never really crossed my
into having a big house and think about
that most people don't have too much
now this pre-approval letter is really
anything this next one is kind of an
hey let's pick up where we left off you
it is very important to take into
with you to make sure that you're a nice
hope you guys found this video helpful
something for access to that service
can trust more because they are able to
important what I would do is go for a
guess what
like Los Angeles or New York well guess
any money but you're getting experience
your house and to do that you're gonna
transmission or you play roller hockey
to put your acting skills to use even
roi before buying you need to know what
reason why i say up to three thousand
so this is a great opportunity for
a reason why most people just never
training to this audition
you're staying top of mind for
that you don't have a lot of room to
find the classes and start
that off and get into character I mean
my sizes and she said no the audition
television shows then I've created a
the more we spend the more we accumulate
medicine skincare and so on
know that you are an agent and what you
saving a ton of money most americans are
youtube course then you could totally
wrong size paper then tomorrow or the
maybe that's when they'll finally ask me
that i have made that has been
doing and by that i mean just
statistics aren't too clear on like the
so this is why you typically just write
work for me and there is another big
studios that you could take classes
what it's like to perform
into the film and television industry my
get a good night's sleep eat some good
what might come up right just in case
more likely the whole process is gonna
films and short films and
is investing into paid education so this
over this one why wait for
tell me wrong tell me why tell me the
business or an online product shop or
my dad was a software engineer and my
essentially it was just like I just
yourself to answer these questions I
my heart of lakewood debut chain
I want to point out is that your
she had outsworth so much in her
instead of an actor you were a graphic
but if you're in one of these local
for the agent to work with you
and you're it's another opportunity to
is the place where the production was
whatever the thing is that you're doing
this cool 360 shot right now
a small market so when you live in a
and if they see that you've been doing
for most television shows the director
continually go back and and relive what
at this point i still have my virtual
director and say hey here's my actor
looks at your resume and wants to
even if you're poor even if you're rich
interest payments as well as affecting
if uh the production makes more money
a lot of actors that start out don't
at the callback who was wearing a
health and fitness side and also on the
health sleep health your fitness health
as well as i'm currently in a mastermind
practice exams they also have custom
the reason they asked this question is
and your name and shame of hunger and
and i just hold on to you at last year
comment too I'd love to hear about the
rental rates are in that area and how
money on
spending like 30 to 40 percent
actually take so
I believe Feldstein Paris was having a
the casting director
on your down payment there are a ton of
third if you are
important throughout all stages of your
audition videos should be horizontal
touching on a lot of the obstacles that
i've i audition for it anyway and then
united states
older ones we also did change out the
so let's just use star wars as an
just so you can get something from them
getting started
middle of the pandemic here in the
availability conflicts refer to the
this is your first time here
the commercial world doesn't use the
company disperses it to
watching all the way to the end I want
negative don't talk about how you just
will book it well the answer to this
other videos the first step to pursuing
starbucks can seem like it's a lot more
and i didn't book any of those initial
basketball game
so in the summer of 2015 we built an
happens too I didn't book the role of
you can
is a great way to kind of just get your
of a self-taped audition that i did at
understanding that we're not starting
and the 48-hour film project goes to
union rules apply and you can be forced
to me you guys i'm not joking the moment
training who know what they're doing so
but to be honest I don't think anyone
was tell me about yourself it wasn't
our body naturally does and a lot of the
the recurring and series regular lines
and producers and everybody else in this
knowledge and uncertainty and that looks
they only found out after the fact that
don't get to take bites out of the kids
sites like actors access
so that's the same thing for an actor
you have a life outside of acting and
and booked that commercial
i want an agent i'm a really good actor
a chance to see the movie before i did
eating really whole foods closer the
offer and sell and you have clients that
make sure to do so right now and get
exactly what I'm gonna be eating because
scams unfortunately in a multi-billion
we can keep a folder of headshots in our
the world like if that's high and you're
actually get the license itself the
lines that were already in the script
opportunity for you another Pro is that
have to go on some actual auditions to
broker someone that can help you figure
the right person for the part
skill than acting knowing how to act as
changed as well
doing as an actor
if the director likes you know a certain
key on my computer to move over to a
so assume you were in a short film
getting started and you don't have an
not going to take you seriously
difference hey that's the truth
for for example a professional headshot
because of that we want to make sure our
going to overpower yours and it's gonna
set i made a little over a thousand
out to tenants
fake information high maintenance and
now a lot of people want to know how to
job what this pretty much means is you
the three thousand dollar initiation fee
this was never this one hand it is how
actors dressing in full costume for
liked for that particular role
days is they like to make it an
starting mark and we're gonna start that
drive to a physical classroom every day
hire local actors
is to use a little bit of math and crop
my youtube videos and my course content
if not I hope you just enjoyed seeing
to go full time in your small business
returns for the last two years
and point you in the right direction let
reviews about the best electronics in
work hard
of investment properties so here are
in order to maintain our jobs and
director or sometimes the casting
can actually take a lot of tax
a lot of times the companies will show
easier to clean you need
you may want to consider not doing
clicking that link right up there
home and working on monologues by
about booking the room
target this new generation of home
teenager said
it really depends on the lender so take
competitive even the tiny one line rolls
later on and lastly you have to know
videos in Final Cut Pro and then you
will be different for every state each
information useful and leave me a
if you don't have anything to show
than you would be able to afford a
colleagues or a fancy watch that you
the process but i think as teenagers or
you train me I was like well I'm not you
first 200 people to click on that link
they were debating now for a
and you don't book any of them and
whenever that deal is struck so let me
everything you do for experience has to
think getting a real estate license can
I remember a few years ago
that is that it's really quite hard to
have to and so those were just three
learned series of videos a couple weeks
doesn't really apply here so you are
either choose 4 inch or 6 inch lights
show agents that you are serious about
dining out
going to pay your children
basically my whole goal is to teach you
obviously recover as well but then the
young actors especially they quit
terms the first term is your headshot
many people aren't many of you may only
phone do not shoot your audition video
your auditions in on time all right
where when I'm pushing play and when I'm
have any trouble selling it or renting
this big lesson that has helped me
in mind what i think about all the time
right but but nobody can really
be paid to you as a pass through
getting that experience
higher and five nights at nick and have
and they will go through it and find
I you know and on one hand it's like
you learn the skills you need to break
perform the way that I need to and then
personally I went with 4 inch because
concrete right here is brand new this is
nobody needs to zoom in on your face and
beginners but i think anyone will find
all of us actors we don't know what's
it was something that I didn't
commercial print model
supporting roles but let's just focus on
department of real estate so that you
like the ceo of a company
some people don't like to give out their
that me and my brother did so if that
they're gonna tear down the walls and
actors and what you should do if you
you're paying off your mortgage there
the vast majority of actors are also
booked the role that girl with the full
standing up for an audition they make no
living but over time our relationship
and Buckingham Fitness for help I know
make a demo reel with
well those students in those filmmaking
lower budget things i've done a ton of
the mid markets will probably all have
different skill set but
my team really consisted of myself i had
on the spot and they give you a little
showcase for
like this has been really really
another thing that you can do to bring
will hear at an audition you definitely
call up the union make a phone call and
the acting career center here to help
when i was acting in cleveland ohio
their mind for future things or for the
representing you to pitch you to casting
casting calls in your area now another
pay you to do something
grout lines and just choose like a white
you're seeing current information so
and according to the commercial
percent of the loan amount generally
for instance it's possible that the
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
in those markets
sides of it I can print my headshot on
unlimited amounts of money then move
you're paying anywhere between 20 and up
commitment to be as low as possible so
a different story
look at it and you're thinking you got
to get more videos on acting auditioning
and in those over 900 auditions
your pre-tax monthly income
consistently do about a couple hours per
at the same time so doing that will make
months to find a property and get your
house hacking with this tax
single cup of coffee
square footage of your home office
the future so look at that neighborhood
on netflix right now that's right you
lot of people right
but there are going to be other people
forward and talk to the little girl like
probably another eight months after the
throughout your entire body for mental
if i'm a company and i wanted to hire
find things that are on sale big stores
the time is a big thing because when
you basically live in one of the units
which movie it is it'll just say
because I can feel where the buttons are
start giving you advice
marvel and that's it and you you'll have
adaptation to create a stimulus so that
didn't say what show it was so that
every single week today we're talking
distribution you need to pay yourself a
word and and the word action
guarantee that we will never forget a
can build up that downpayment it's not
resume well that is dictated by the
conversation with somebody else i walked
an audition you can also pay for a 68
and you're ready for it and you're
director might say you know what I
state's real estate department they'll
it up here at home we're talking about
downsides now like I briefly mentioned
fee before signing you to a contract
that like button and also subscribe to
and acting in this type of work even if
finding anything it really is a complex
yourself so that you can buy and sell
not in every single city especially in
going with a 30-year fixed because the
gonna that's you know all of us people
this scene that means you're just gonna
same folder and now it's done then we'll
yeah yeah
okay that's fine i'll still live out of
important to mention that auditioning
these types of things these types of
save or invest that money so with that
television market
this sustainable for me is there are
and i think when we talk about the
other actors to see so if you've got a
own it would give them much more
is to work on a team make sure you have
still cheaper than the warranty cost the
under that section and maybe just next
industrial videos and training videos
spending some time here with me today if
harder it is to sell in the future you
brother so I have to know like it
this role of george because we had seen
actor and
with questions go head and use this and
to set metrics as a real estate agent no
and i'm saving about 500 per year for
give the
first real estate investment property
stronger these days you pretty much have
and that very well may have happened to
so why 20% why is that the magic number
buckingham fitness what's up Tyler how
acting for a company a company is using
ever joined the union while living in
submissions from all kinds of crazy
doesn't matter if i took a theater job
and all of those things which is
haven't seen that
particular job so you won't get
beginning in the beginning it was this
the acting career center here to help
casting director
want to get it to the point where
know just going out there and buying
something else we're walking and talking
single week in today's video I interview
about it as one of the first stepping
change the lines and they change the
that you can spend your own time cold
hours to pittsburgh i did my audition
probably the easiest way is just to hire
mortgage your property taxes and any
the link is in the description below
an aspect of life that we don't often
because let's face it when we're first
real estate if your real estate business
that we're buying firstly did i receive
to help me book over 50 movies and
two to three to four million dollars now
hard to understand what those things are
exercising for it to even be effective
already which was great and once again i
camera even in an unscripted situation
often offer a filmmaking program and
major blockbuster hollywood movie but
quickly to the first person who applies
turnkey and there are just tons of
needlessly big and luxurious homes
potentially other roles in that project
multiple marks on the ground they might
poem from the early 1900's that goes as
make your place look like a luxury hotel
rich to start so why aren't more people
you what i believe have been the best
know there's obviously there's gonna be
to get to the point where the casting
game and know
really excited so how did i book that
don't regret studying computer science
on its own and that's definitely
just like looking at the scale every day
they actually invested but with all this
thing that i want to mention with
more about choosing great quality
so once you've got that experience under
by going to that playlist right there
extremely extremely common so with a
audition cheat sheet that you can
so-called talent agencies that promised
that's because there are so many factors
this off and this brings me into my next
indirect cost for an acting career and
have an emergency fund
short films web series plays community
Tim Ferriss who kind of modeled this
we're gonna put one more line down here
so that's just kind of what I would do
other line none of the actors in the
is taking that shot of tequila right now
theater and all kinds of stuff
about two or three days later um
it simple
i've actually put together
self-taped auditions so when i got the
ohio back in 2008 and in 2016
say hey i want to join they tell you to
that like button and also subscribe to
it would have had to be a much much
term book the room before i'll explain
won't be disappointed in me if you cast
to tell you how much of a genius I am
so george lucas the name of the director
the memorization techniques that I use
get your license as it will definitely
make especially
on camera but you're also learning how
and this is a quick quick sidebar BMI is
thought they needed me next week and
12 steps every actor should take to
for a credit card of your own what you
it's your brand visuals all of those
think it's not worth your time to
in that way my website and make it an
winning actors nowadays a lot of them
buying enough things you can make a load
avengers endgame
of people out there who are vegan and I
in in every study that's been done on
right up there okay let's talk about how
than x then that is a good
uh independent films on those types of
how likely am I to book it well we're
examinations pay for maybe a realtor
added a new overhang right here with
with that being said i encourage you
translates to the camera guess what even
be spent just marketing yourself so
there is something big
film and television i've actually made a
physical on set
your career you can have a pretty
my gosh you're asking me to
an agent then it has to be your agent's
HP or Epson or something like that for
all about acting in atlanta i'll put a
little bit more risky so you definitely
we've all done if I book this role then
keep learning and I hope to see you on
outside of that particular industry
take a look see what you can cut out and
completely false
really well and keeping up with their
going to be talking about
demo reel right what is it used for well
out there a ton of real estate agents
makes more money in the back end off of
and you can elect
late I know I'm not gonna get a lot of
and if you can do that if you can get
and because of that they needed another
footage that we can use for ourselves
websites that may cost some money in
focus on in my opinion every successful
enough to comfortably afford that
and that is that you can offer to work
when they find out they didn't book
also could potentially
back to the casting director and say hey
actor is going to say every single actor
yourself for auditions and talent
who are willing to hear my message and
show you how to
not just in the background you're
setting up the lights and the camera and
and about how you want to house hack and
one audition for a movie per year on
on tv shows too and sometimes in movies
there for free but the whole point is
now if you run that through your sole
person so whether we're talking about
she also does a lot of content copy for
either anybody's phone
casting websites are actors access
finance investing in entrepreneurship
hey if it works for an Oscar winner it's
good actors
are ones that work more in alignment
also have to be okay
topics we covered
all the barriers to investing anyways if
booked my very first speaking role in a
your computer right now make sure your
a desk
know anything but i want you to
throughout my career for myself and for
less than one percent of my auditions
and thinks that stunt performing might
video here in my hotel room
on my list
project that i was in
there can be a desire to put
of themselves
will serve you for the rest of your
more importantly your time
now this is actually a heavily debated
casting networks
the good news is you don't have to spend
it's not the first thing you should be
broadway this isn't the big shows that
and you'll find that once you get
until next time keep practicing keep
one it was the battery or whatever there
director in three years because of it I
and i almost quit college and did it but
and the name of the school the
that's why it's so exciting and it's a
animated movies animated shows you could
things are posted publicly on casting
approach our characters and how we
can literally change your life
less food today
no more looking at my phone after that
standpoint and you know definitely enjoy
house people loved this kitchen because
and you are ready to go into your
finance investing in entrepreneurship
labor union here in the united states
get you on your way down i don't have it
breakdown okay and once i find that
change this line and then change this
up so much
acting experience helped me
by them to your own homes or for
expect to pay probably not much more
your course then you will apply to take
but the problem with this whole I want
there's a role for
learning my lines and I love acting
first gonna be reading the actual words
in a few months and chances are you'll
you can get a lot of on set experience
to get up at 5 a.m. and other days you
follow these steps i guarantee you'll
payment and you can actually just
fixer-upper then do everything I just
resume and shrink the font so it all
I still don't go to my auditions dressed
and so the audience doesn't need to be
necessarily need to be caucasian so they
that you're working on while pursuing
easiest way of getting people to know
on these things because that's what's
they all allow you to do the same thing
first place I lived in Atlanta was in
auditions it's time to start
is full price clothing i know that when
thinking about whether or not you should
highest income bracket meaning you're
when you can reinvest the money you're
every time a new role is posted that
change it to something that's just
thing with eating right you can easily
even if your future goals do not include
entrepreneurship and investing I'll see
markets like los angeles
of your union bookings that means
then i've created a free audition cheat
in new york or los angeles i would have
can audition
about what to wear to an audition the
these two agencies they solely exist to
link you can follow along you can just
they could potentially add footage to
keep pushing forward and keep working
don't even book them
people to hit that link will get 20
to talk about was specifically for
don't know i don't really know much
product thing it's something I'm kind of
own boss and to do your own thing and
tv and radio hosts and some other
you can do real estate part-time but
i'm going to copy and paste
like how to join when to join whether or
correct industry term is audition sides
and you can spend it doing a lot more
can learn CSS in two days and then you
but i truly i think it is i think you
auditions is that they send out one
so I'll do something like this when I
build wealth and set yourself up for the
she's tiny any time we'd go to Kennesaw
until i got another email from my agent
loan defaults it's a way for them to
because i need the money from it
encourage you
get inspire youtube home an D is one of
commission off of all union jobs sag
your agent which locations which pockets
fastest internet unless you're uploading
making it in this industry so i've said
seven memorization techniques to help
mentioned this multiple times during my
places you look for information from
speaking of resources you can download
work with
this there's no need to bring in a paint
those are
professional if we make even little
are found on lots of the older homes
awesome experience for anybody who is
now if you're interested in learning
purpose you were created in a unique way
the 10 commandments of self taping so
it was just one of those books that and
it really changed my mindset when it
and now we have time to get ready for
real estate license there are tons of
spectrum and if your credit score is a
throwing money away buying these
gone in two a or two and then come back
what to put on it now before we get
and then i drove two hours back home to
homes for yourself then you might not
best if there were only water fills steps there
meet other actors so that you can work
the walking dead for instance
recommendations or knowledge about the
don't know when that's going to happen
have a bookshelf that
have taken classes and you've got
not like it and they might not want to
marketing purposes and exposure purposes
the same vocabulary the same topics and
watch on netflix in 2020
fans those are the people that let's say
spending what you're able to afford
so your part needs to be able to fit
and remember to subscribe to this
and it's just been amazing and i'm just
admission to harvard and
atlanta isn't right for you
think personally it's smart to having a
sometimes two three four five hundred
people will ask well why do i have to
prints awesome quality headshots and it
is that
helped me get the role that i eventually
and check out if they do something in
you can write off 57.5 cents
I did disc in my back I tore my
audition is what's happening in your
comfortable to you
it operates never been healthier I
part of it we already talked about the
gigantic like 15 unit apartment complex
you can ask your teacher or other
very underused method but you can
home and now you've wasted all that
just to
money online we need to be providing
television shows
it is a good way to meet a lot of people
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
section we don't use the same co-star
have a theater background and that's
that i've invested in the things that
down a super low down payment is through
this place is like upwork and fiber that
you're doing something that works for
auditioning and career advice every
the commercial
process that i have used in the past
take your course to take the exam and
that story of like choosing to go full
really show hey you can get a really
debate or perhaps use it to negotiate
never once have they asked me to do a
project understand that whenever you
like internally I'm fighting myself and
the master bedroom and then the other
really helps because you're not just
someone has told us something similar
great thing about the conventional loan
specific role for a project
should be able to watch your demo demo
right and and because of that taking
so for example let's say you start
from it as well
remember this new line and then also
in a really good position to jump into
keep you
get to this point and you're only
i guarantee you you're going to save
fits each role so for simplicity's sake
475 000 and putting 25k
to determine whether or not you have to
if those sacrifices are worth it to you
are you going to want to pay that
get new headshots taken
i mentioned earlier that yes you are
to a new city to pursue acting to have
maybe they needed someone older or maybe
up to make sure you will always turn
taxes either this works if they are your
mortgage insurance premium that is
interested in learning the audition
life and i'm definitely not that six
open house and when you put a house on
and they get paid time off and they're
he's this former Navy SEAL or is it more
arrange the logistics and the shipping
but i built that relationship with the
posted publicly so that you
drama club may have school plays
something posted on their website of how
both of those are union states where
see me in one scene well guess what the
youtube video in about
full-time without doing it full-time and
move to this city
what exactly are those agents looking
the emmy-winning actors of today a lot
fast rules that don't have any
avoidable i think almost everyone
a great solid foundation for your
hard and eventually
when you first begin expect your income
in this video I want to share with you
is just a massive bollock whereas
time house hacker the best deals are
um even with so I have a 34:30 group
think it's needed so in this section i'm
are the best acting teachers in
shooting another commercial
able to make your payments and for them
pros section with an open mind and just
so many new things about all of these
you know exactly
paying your bills on time or just
going to count as a residential property
and just real quick the the biggest
I keep preaching about it but it really
Naked cakes with history of dying friend
and of course you'll have to find a real
so the next question that i get
you're all the way at the bottom at a
acting let's face it we aren't studying
commercials actors see a lot of
keep practicing keep learning and i hope
products i think that's super ridiculous
valuable free content for every right
the gospel movie goes away This is at worst
to make sure you hold the viewers
doing so all right that's my take on
situation throughout my entire audition
you can copy and paste
that you have into a perfect headshot
me talk all day which believe me I get
results that you're seeing in other
so that's how an agent makes money they
and it was for a different product so
because there was something that was
show and you are no longer allowed to
we're creating right now
spending their time learning
everything this was a really great
five hundred thousand dollars then like
now i've talked about actor finances
to demonstrate that
the class and you've liked absorb the
all of those things that you you can
have a little bit more confidence in
I want to point out two more things that
and everything that I've done that is a
these are primarily for actors so since
your body needs to be in a position
got my start there's only two things we
of mindset you have
work for them if you look at the numbers
viewers attention from my face you want
side Kelly what are you doing
on them completely they are your guide
don't try and push myself too hard you
um all right so that's it for this video
let's discuss
out of Los Angeles said you do whatever
by just doing what everyone else is
out to dozens of agents
as a doctor in the NHS the UK's National
or too big thanks to technology and also
let's say you did a short film or a
to your two that means go stand over on
available to actors you just have to
I've used this guy for many many years
making people buy things
entrepreneurs or
you could be sweeping the floor you can
distinction between hollywood the city
potentially take you out of
acting classes that you could benefit
into the film and television industry my
understanding this concept is really
a result that type of mindset makes it
please subscribe to this channel and
succeed I want you to be that series
you increase your chances dramatically
instead of debit cards debit cards are
five million dollars and even more than
a great training ground for your future
are not going to be any more free acting
now according to business insider
you go to the blog post after watching
yeah so the thirty four thirty group is
is with a tripod self taping commandment
sell things on craigslist for fun it
personal question that you're gonna have
live in one of those bedrooms so if i
now if you're interested in learning how
let me know down in the comments if you
gonna make the most money for you based
screen protector who I've been
yes it's going to cost some money it's
earning a fair wage for the work that
into being full-time
actors will incur but we're
right financing
headshot is as professional as possible
succeed has nothing to do with their
resume just so they can see
come we tend to just quit
20 percent on non-union jobs
purchases of anything including
the acting teacher and the students
where you can't keep up with both
or time on your self education now i'm
an agent only makes a 10 commission off
no matter how you find these classes
actors have demo reels and half don't
warm-up and everything but you can do
the point is that those first few
was non-union so when i lived there if i
recommend that if you're going to do
not going to be possible and everyone's
gives me much more to work with and
and cheapest course available online and
a daily habit make it maybe once or
investing by one single year is going to
download by going to that link
think that llcs
but really this is absolutely going to
the comments put me in touch with them i
actually have a link to real estate
and so started doing it and I started to
see you guys in the next video
if you're not into coding there are
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
series regular okay
toilets range from maybe a hundred bucks
single time i from download free she
and you have a professional headshot and
theater even if your future goals really
they are filmed in other states and
a link to it
so come up with something unique that'll
goes towards building your own credit my
acting class
as long as it's good obviously has to be
so this is why most actors really want
watch cobra kai on netflix
but i still do think that it's very
people asking for business so yeah if
asked my agent
the 12 steps every actor needs to take
to go into the office every day from
reason behind this is that if you go to
television industry
any benefits or any of those things
just suit my schedule right we oh you're
hollywood it was filmed in pittsburgh
you say it that's why I like to talk
agents out there there's so much
then they will have more confidence in
and education
9:00 to 5:00 p.m. you put in however
just because they are brand name
and oh my gosh it's just i feel like
because i do think there is such a thing
is only one piece of the puzzle it's an
boss and you put
I can be like I said walking my dog and
part that no one actually cares about
so it's a great way to get started to
one works well for you there you go
I'm married and I live in Omaha
for an acting resume is that background
that will get you a favorable interest
is not to book the role our job is to
I see those pictures and I was like man
government because it means that you are
reasons why i think atlanta is the best
somebody else but if it's not working
if you ask me all right number 10 on my
if they do their tax rate is going to be
is this book self-management for actors
because if my audition was good enough
credits maybe at that point is a time
but it really depends on your situation
i wasn't released i got good news i
ones is a website called actors access
taught in the classroom but i still feel
off of your paycheck this is great
you get MLS access now to get your start
trying to get out of this workout is it
until next time keep practicing keep
thanks I wanna you don't want to get to
booking percentages my booking
class right now totally understandable
is pricing it right price it at market
learn how to do it well you're gonna
finances i know that can be really
is that we could make a pretty-looking
how you can save money on them and any
directors production companies and
and that it comes from something else
that's when you should get your license
properties to house hack
those things okay so in this video we're
producer in your area this is a more
i'm still working on that project that i
you want to spend
do a monologue
into the film and television industry
acting resumes so in this video i'm
lower budget independent films again
you got an audition for a commercial and
one-time cost of time or money to make
value out of this video do me a favor
well that's the number that lenders use
but before we get started i just want to
most likely only getting a chance
definitely gotta make sure that you have
recap on the timeline here because i got
are three levels of making money online
private studio
numbers are going to be
that can get me onto a team that sounds
it's cool because the portion of your
have my heart is heavy on either for
this is the single most important
the other actors in the scene having
now in addition to on stage experience
everything that I know and everything
ever read so i will put a link to self
sources and i'll speak about that later
the movies and television shows that
but you have to look at it as a business
the analysis and one direction classes is
major movie
job and career um you know I always
are at home all day some days we're on
actor and in order to be a professional
knowledge about they're also a really
and sure i was bummed about it for a
you can make from it so you can really
house by a lot so this brings me to the
bringing in any income
that you will book the part but a bad
very easy
in your market another thing that you
characters it doesn't just a
take into consideration so
believable and compelling fashion but I
find your projected net operating income
gigabytes of files per day or per month
step 8 is the casting director reviewing
floors just let my gym be free and then
plus I think it looks more professional
through working with a scene partner and
wrong choices this yeah Numa works and
really helps you now rehearse the actual
it on to the casting directors
how much an
a television section i'm gonna add a
but it's really just such a great book
like lying on the couch and and just
to not only have that emergency fund
much house you can afford so to do this
if i can't get work right it's kind of a
but over the next few years my residual
casting calls and one more thing at some
photographer is someone with industry
or could not be callbacks depending on
you can do to get clients is to buy
perfect for this
anybody who was cut from the project i
kind of three broad categories of things
credit score so let's say that you have
even if you don't book it well for a
earlier this year so number one is uh
short-term and the long-term strategy
this is what you really want and you
the value of the home
links to buckingham Fitness his website
account with head of so you need only a
I had a bunch of agents call me and try
that you got these things on sale you
your acting career
again that's what they really want to
changed our schedule
your equity in the home so it's
doesn't take too much time to actually
here and then other skills that you may
matter if you're a service based
that actors make money within this
but i really want to play in the nba so
haven't yet start investing i really
actress at the moment
because of this I can't do this because
getting started it's important to be
even better so keeping all this in mind
for instance when i joined sag-aftra
keep practicing keep learning
easiest simplest form of exercise
different ways to find auditions without
be quite hard to find someone like that
i'm going to copy and paste again so it
earlier this year and i didn't book it
then extends an offer to the agent of
your state exam you'll wait for that to
like a bet they spent so much money on
should go without saying but I've heard
logo this is cobra kai
a real agent doesn't charge you any
want to take on that by yourself and
auditions i just want to say if you are
is it any wonder that we've come to take
you might not save money compared to
of that property is its building value
actually have control over
into the film and television industry my
next is the bathrooms bathrooms can be
but I still didn't start buckingham
owning it protecting it worrying about
even more than one brown some will have
you know i did well on them but i didn't
and you saw all those movies and
ways to find auditions without an
your homework and make sure any agency
narrowed down to two actors and they
instead of needing you here in atlanta
house it is also extremely useful for
any Facebook groups for actors and
follows money is a matter of functions
that i've been in for about six months
be a power lifter and lift more weights
eating I like to call them lifestyles
you can start small with your own home
people because
get involved in acting in school because
real estate for almost 30 years now and
back and forth with you I feel like
my name is charlie and i am a real
state has their own specific course that
you know comes from it goes from
audition or i go on 20 auditions and i
they wanted
are constantly networking with casting
mimic the real estate exam questions by
people who don't really want to be in
just the
outside i grabbed his professional life
every business needs a marketing plan
undercut you won't get taken advantage
get representation
buckingham Fitness on the on the route
run through my lines the first thing I
and your online casting profiles like
and i guarantee you the test is gonna be
portfolio of stocks then investing as
or trainings all these things can be tax
a studio that is based in hollywood that
you know I yes it has to be sustainable
totally makes sense yeah and so another
have you been doing everything that you
it would be a good idea to wear
you'll see that it could take
they use that audition to consider you
will also help you in the next part of
then write it off okay in conclusion you
becoming a an assistant to a top
camera what's the solution keep doing it
enough money to put down 20% it's either
different things
happens and
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
everybody needs to read it because it
actors can make money in the industry is
that's how much you'd be saving by
reasons why a casting director a
your personality looks on camera it's
zillow will actually syndicate it with a
just gonna bring down the energy in the
lot of people are like well if I'm not
get you an audition or wants to book you
dozens and dozens of movies and
acting career you might be wondering
that two to six hundred dollars might be
and then you have something to show them
is pre-negotiated for every time that
same we're using the three columns
want to shop and you guys i know you can
you are an actor as well let's let's
share with everybody be it a book or a
of the professional tools
legit ways of making money online but
when i auditioned for the show cobra kai
headshots are the actors business card
look totally different than before I've
this industry is by being a stunt
takes a lot of work to do those
the state that i live in
considering this will affect the risk
really easy to understand manner and it
for some amazing projects so
streaming services now i will say that
people that have done this successfully
auditioning for the role well I'd say
because of misleading ads it's the whole
between the husband and the wife while
renovations that's people that came to
absolutely have to know before getting a
the union you should expect to pay
three main things that i went
incredible for you know no matter i
without an agent can go onto those
to fill no single day is alike some days
you need to door not cold call you need
now anytime you get a callback it's a
no tofu is about four and a half pounds
one doing everything and you can focus
my number one tip is to sign up for some
right to it
definitely have
just like with headshots don't rush to
a priority to me in my business not just
blank you want to really solidify those
but my parents they just didn't spend
obstacle that that holds a lot of people
lot of people will say is
getting that audition and doing it was a
including movies and tv shows
numbers look good but don't get caught
because there are great agencies out
and photo paper we are just about ready
i still use some of these methods myself
to save you a lot of money it's going to
you gotta really love the craft
him based on another live
with dialogue they will never ask you to
any of this stuff is to just enroll in
look at the school data it's all really
and new toilets are a lot nicer than the
acting books
it's really hard then to fit sometimes
you when you when you said that the
smaller projects too
with double-sided tape however you put
an aesthetic you're going for and you're
it on there your resume should be on the
they're not being left out of the loop
gonna help you out a ton just based on
take 2 take 3 it's the same thing at
how to do it and all of that so i
the people that work behind the camera
awesome right yeah trying to save paper
really taught me that we don't need to
away ready step number one is to do some
the reason i say that is this i've
you understand what an actor's schedule
it even though the description of the
straight auditions without booking a
classes and your phone without you can
get your money out it's just a waste and
time you walk
agencies take a class and put all your
process after you've memorized it all
paying tax one time
estate agent the next really important
but if you want to just follow along the
to grow your acting career because i
at whatever pace i wanted to do and
whether or not to sign you now if you're
know basis if you don't need to know
real estate agent in about 10 years is
house the other thing that you will talk
if you want to pursue
idea how to answer it but the whole
would the casting director send me this
all of those credits onto your acting
shopping for the last like
you can teach the thing and I think a
through a space during a scene typically
is a specific spot on the floor that
transition into something else but at
i haven't seen it yet but some of my
and then now now we're in quarantine so
auditioning for a project
neighborhood playhouse
better and a lot more interesting on
and the cash on cash return right here
prepared for it and you understand that
is because
they have to provide proper benefits to
if you've graduated from school already
a film career then i understand that
single one so I hope this actually
searching for the nearest big city
monthly payment of twenty seven hundred
it and it saves money which I think most
it to you
it to I want to eat this because I want
actually put them in a scene with a
extremely important you don't want to
your expenses are personally how much
you're welcome so I see you at the
logos making whatever it is that they
you are now
sort of me the same but you know some of
that or they choose not to between
oh it's on the back well trust me it's
people say hey i want to be an actor so
didn't get the part
questions as i can
a lot of people actually never switch
a lot of actors want to know how to get
why would i waste my time looking at the
your brand like all of those things are
industry standard is to only write
to buy 8 by 10 photo paper as for the
there was no mention that shaq
actors or
commercial so they might say here's the
yourself you can use zillow rental
in here to achieve financial
built this gas fireplace right here so
the actual exercising part of it and
they just needed someone of a different
to spend
brother is a seven-time national
the first few times in your career
and it greatly reduced my living
witnessed it working for someone else
professions as well but we're not really
headshots at home it is super easy and
help you with real estate investing
downloaded my free 10 step audition
not about what you say it's about how
now this can cost anywhere between i'd
made was there's a janky looking HTML
and stuff like that like I do to an
like you might hire the same family
get an audition you better know how to
warranty date and the truth is that
buy a home with a VA loan right now it's
videos on acting
i'll say about acting classes
gaining experience and get to the point
keep learning keep practicing and i hope
on camera feel more normal because the
the mental toughness to handle this
for joining me here today
works i'm going to give you a kind of a
because it suddenly becomes scalable
on if I'm always going to the gym and
you will be trust me on that don't tie
you decide to join the union
you that audition so always take that
lot of people might be
that's just because more people like
think it really depends on your state
it's like well tv/film we don't have a
asset and then sell it for more later on
else's stuff is absolutely fine but
now this is the step where you actually
for yourself taped audition as well self
you're getting your rest and make sure
really appreciate
ratio or else when we print we're
want to know why they asked you this
raise that camera too
back which I greatly appreciated but
you know it was a whole thing in my my
the second way to find auditions without
i must be terrible i quit that that
my take when it comes to using props
find a different time
with your friends
time in in the acting actor's career
how you
into the agency's office asking for
top and that's just impossible so
income in your business
hundred and sixty eight hours and the
want to do they want to pursue
one of the best ways to build long-term
never even auditioned for that movie
have the best trip score available so
once you paint it it's not going to
to see results people think we'll I ate
to save money wherever they can and one
seriously want to pursue a career in
television shows
the producers of the show and the
mobility you know if you're in the honey
the course content
minute but the first lesson that I
that you plan to live in to pursue
rather than the person who submits to
happens all the time
in to the film and television industry
for yourself right this means that you
day and how do we keep how do we keep
your future goals are to become
some people
having a lot of fun working on this
don't have a demo reel what does your
you to show them your work to show them
own first property as well thanks you
what blocking is is the movement that
understand that you will have to pay
where do you actually find these
using the backup camera on your Toyota
Evil Inf Escape orfast no way the new
you enjoyed this video and i'll see you
at that point i hadn't photographed any
out there that can provide you for x
just a little peek behind the things
oil you can sell here there is no
lesson because growing up
turnkey properties third is you must
a show called just beyond that just came
and the yale school of drama i'm pretty
if you're in college look for theater
instagram or facebook or wherever
blocks or stepping stones into why did i
but they also want to see you reacting
it's actually the audition preparation
people they just wait too long until
step number 12 is to be patient and
interesting because it forces us to
saving on taxes
paid for it what can be better
posted publicly
but they would be able to instantly turn
was better at all of those things than i
you've given my father
to start owning real estate and building
now i think everyone would agree that
is that there are certain factors that
the rule of thumb is to not list your
producer sessions and network tests and
whether you are using a phone a
four on my list
fix and flips
that i think you should focus your work
gonna get that investment back the
of going through the motions and just
that's gonna mean that you're paying
that's gonna be 90% so be lower the down
community theater where you can get
maintain our jobs job costuming
riding on your knowledge and expertise
social time or no free time or a
this past monday on nbc i played dr cho
- they want to see if your personality
down in the description below the next
rent that out you can also convert
bookshelf let's say it costs
but don't just give me a thumbs down
distribution to the logistics that are
of these rooms or if it's a multi-unit
it's a TV set and we're a recurring
if you are the type of person who
eyes got to pick on my dogs Boop I
be very very smart so first up is being
that are in your market seek advice from
can go around knocking on doors in your
comfortable with it took the role I'm
yet then you know you'll have to wait a
everybody so that means you're probably
and also please please please
attention on your face at all times so I
great program and it's great for
a producer or a director or writer or
you guys a little story about
or a 15 or a 20 commission we won't get
on set
taxed as a sole proprietorship however
sometimes in certain markets and certain
that topic because we're talking about
their lines in fact Academy Award winner
there are ways to get your first few
because agents need a professional
good my my career will go on you don't
there is
the next day i was super happy i had no
resource that you have found
income is uncapped what i mean by this
tempting to just be able to go to
it out gone are the days when you have
this by yourself unless you have
not that at 26 i was
and not do it I'm in a much better
effect at the end that'd be awesome and
script we read a lot faster than we
you're interested in learning more about
mobility and stuff even-even yoga
freedom to record it however I wanted my
that actors can supplement their income
and the whole escrow process once you do
and decide that they don't want to hire
plenty of scammers out there trying to
directly into the camera lens the next
where's all the life that we supposedly
and they're repainting their bedroom but
one day
real estate agent in the world you can
so much more to talk about there's some
video that a lot of people were saying
get your stuff out there so that people
they do
so i really do that is one of my regrets
flowdesk and flowdesk is the email list
especially this month this has been the
making your monthly payment
joining me today if you haven't already
yeah like Steven Seagal's character in
filmmaking so for example let's say you
number five my email list so i hope that
casting profiles like actors access or
or work with them on a zoom call or
the right way to add credits to your
core capital realty i'll put something
able to submit myself and get auditions
so you want to know how to become an
a lot to pay for some people and there
ever auditioning for it
one of the best licenses to get but
for pig i love this week at access
same thing with acting the first step is
before i booked my role
commission to another realtor
clicks on that link and buys from Amazon
and i hope to see you on set one day
audition how likely we are to get the
share with you a couple tips from two
things are things that you are paying
actors that fit this role
audition and they tell you that your
actors access to the same degree the
less furniture and overall your life
perform in front of an audience
are lower where the pressure is lower
atlanta right so like i said this is a
one i would recommend everybody watch it
still a chance that you don't get cast
of course not every area is going to
in theater from high school or even
gonna get the
personally met people that were scammed
instead of getting a script
days for a reason because knowin is
working conditions for
you learn the skills you need to break
soon as possible since you're able to
hire a real estate agent in the area
personally i think this is great for the
on paper and if you're an active
yourself then head over to brilliant.org
gain experience to start acting in front
you put in there you can look at past
which talks about how i developed
check out weeble get your free stocks
other loan programs that are extremely
roster of actors of all ages of all
well as we've said in the beginning when
you doing Kurt I am doing well thanks
money up front to start working with you
action as soon as you can because in the
to have the highest credit score you can
steer my answer towards talking about my
ask yourself this do I currently own a
beforehand right we worked on our lines
however as you move forward in your
is horizontal many of you will want to
an amateur so let's get right to the 20
it's it's the sort of thing that really
as extremely challenging but one big
honestly is with other students in your
about the patient's part of it right and
have a huge audience
defendant he has a friend i was ok this gomide
earlier on in the beginning of the video
thought that these things were things
the casting breakdown or the character
actors we individually
cities they're doing this because they
a career here in the united states and
rapper's receipt has made a huge
feet wet to get your
season so people probably aren't too
director or on actors access or some
at things like bayesian networks causal
have an emergency fund
movie role in won't bat down
there was one take that I remember where
where it's ready to perform on the day
specifically i've put links to all three
many of these projects are going to be
was going to be important later on
that come with that but not only that at
making money in real estate works
i wasn't thinking clearly that night we
it's generally 30 days of escrow and
keep practicing keep learning and i hope
i played a doctor which i tend to a lot
you learn the skills you need to break
um you know even one-on-one coaching or
first try all right I'll see you guys in
homes for them to see so yeah right when
all the amazing tax benefits that come
spend five to ten hours
need a scene partner again and that
if your scenes were cut and you're no
they are only going through agents and
sports performance if it was you know
then tell them about it be the type of
10-step audition preparation cheat sheet
also make more
it's possible that the repair costs are
that you actually did the play now one
character breakdown is more or less a
the living room it's gonna make the
that gets easier the more that you do it
faster well the truth is
a week after that i was notified that i
job interview so practice auditioning as
thing from a lender's viewpoint they're
acting coaches or teachers or personal
about with the lender is
and get experience that way by doing
routines whether it's with our sleep
job needs to be something that we
house the more potential buyers there
this works mostly at places like
an email and so it can be a really
the website for the exact number and
things that you are working through and
they have to pay their per diem while
Academy and then trying to build your
20 for long-term capital gains this
story because they will often want to
the star of today's video my dog tofu
draw that right here you are going to be
or you can hire a property manager to do
Twitter lunch yeah and because that's
bed head on the pillow and I will read
early remember that once you become a
30th so it was a total of 21 days
once you do sign with your first agent
my name is Kurt you thank you for
i recommend just have some of these
fundamentals of computer science
when keeping the things that you rarely
not in the sense because you don't have
now that's going to be up to you whether
the links down there but i do have a
up and don't forget to subscribe if you
up to a whopping
instagram stories
are on the right track if you want to
have appreciation on your side then
and then just cancel out the other
for commercials as well because of the
insurance premium this is going to range
worker role the casting director could
colleges especially here in the us
about my audition process that has
our identities from them
completely off book yet but you also
this will allow you to write off your
not having enough money to pay your
months of renovations for this place we
we'll save that for another video my
through the lines without doing any
production i mean
it says aspect ratio under aspect ratio
of that file and make sure you don't
have a massive
however don't listen to that don't think
union states they do apply
hey if you haven't already you
time under 10 that my body is under
keep your file sizes small remember that
they just weren't coming because i was i
the character that you're auditioning
spelled his name wrong
first up on my list is brand name
in order to succeed in this business for
with money
money somewhere else
absolutely essential for modern day
building that relationship you're
to understand the potential drawbacks of
a lot saved up now what I like to tell
prepare for it and how to deliver a
had been working together for so long
retirement plan
with a partner with a scene partner
if you have a website you can put that
money and you guys i can upload a
look like a professional actor and not
getting an agent is much more like
super cheap it's very easy you can even
that they will be shooting on set that
to help you
times people you know people look at the
professionals they know what to do they
now that we have the mortgage stuff out
as a film and television actor you see a
way too long
many contacts experience good
like unless you also own a business it's
and that can be a really good
tofu so that was it pretty short and
the reason being if you go into a
you like decorating with your things or
the description of this video so that
and what i recommend doing is paying
and then i drove two hours back home to
part of a role we'd be uncomfortable
a first
we can make the thing once and then we
want to be the best you should do it
paycheck after they book you a job if
do it yourself what I'll do is choose
much as possible
is like and whether you're working all
at the end of the day regardless because
hey how you doing huh sorry I'm late I'm
proprietorship you're gonna be paying
jobs and the history of work and how we
doesn't have
mitigate their risks and these risks get
doing this you are looking at all the
how' steep and story feeling low of
leave them down in the comments below
do i regret moving to atlanta instead of
because when i got my first audition i
get experience
hey give me some auditions
from doing a play
all right if you like this video please
what these sections are so here the
photos or
down I think that's a mistake
people actually don't know that they can
safety protocols that's dictated by the
name is Kurt you thank you so much for
people are scared but you definitely
look at the population changes you can
so let's say you book a role on stranger
to tell their story okay now that we
of friends that have moved out there
even if you don't book that particular
so please do as much research as you can
really wasteful water bottles it's going
shaq's parts in a totally separate room
management for actors
start thinking about how you're going to
different and then they wanted the
questions and they also
towards your own career
much each of those things should cost
on the day when we shot my scenes
digital is it's better but there's
then I gained 45 pounds just and it was
who wrote a famous essay ages ago called
as well as you're acting while you're
your free four stocks all you have to do
because all they need is a short little
only if i work on union projects here in
courses are all engaging and interactive
if your resume looks like this and it's
that movie had three major hollywood
in a college town you can rent out maybe
are made in the same factories as the
marvel movies and netflix shows as stunt
instead of thinking of money as this
but you can also do a sep if you want so
investment or rental property if you
training under their belt
self-taped audition is when an
other projects and potentially just for
going to make any sense because you
they stain really easily a kitchen
treated the actors well
is to improvise a scenario where you
estate you know for the long term so i
like they waited until the very last
ready to become
don't get better they don't get stronger
are for sure a scam so run the other way
right to work st right to work rules
you're gonna have to be uploading these
video give it a thumbs up and let me
i think that the real cost of trying to
appreciation okay next up is you need to
that i want you guys
another chances are
they're still laughing and then they do
I don't want to pay mortgage insurance
to do a short-term rental on airbnb for
um being organized with things and
experience of fulfillment and the amount
please give them an audition now if you
sure you've heard this term before
and sometimes actors would just say well
and throw up this cute photo on
you gotta know how to really control
people in the mastermind i was learning
atmosphere where i love this time of
really real estate is not the only thing
buy a home much sooner than if they were
the acting career center here to help
hollywood movie just because a movie is
your social media you know what's going
but you may need to spend some money in
message that we don't know what we're
the lower an interest rate that they are
something with their phone
about one to two years past the original
find one house that makes sense and that
streaming services they are way better
you can download it right now at the
waiting for a competition to come around
roommate and the net cost was much lower
to be an actor
separate piece of paper
being cast in that type of role so when
performer now this is a completely
buy a house i always tell people
you shouldn't be pursuing an agent right
one way they can
to jump to this step
website design is from elizabeth mccravy
from professional serious actors another
one spot and do the scene that way but
cost anything extra for you i guarantee
what i mean by that i mean that
audition talent agents are going to be
cash flow calculating profit there are
if it were easy everyone would do it so
this is the
local actors are not union
the sacrifices are not going to be worth
unexpected repairs for example what if
get your future appreciation the price
on an acting resume all right moving on
your headshot your resume right there in
websites so
getting hit with a huge bill
created a list of self taping tools on
is using it but whereas a commercial
that's not how it works
which is my 10-step audition preparation
important to get really good lighting in
think about this
at learning Python which is the world's
down what I still have booked it who
keep the wheels turning so and where
and then finally the last column is the
most people to avoid doing background
definitely it helped me process my
commercial so they said
actual audition deadline for instance if
have time to watch thousands of
for money from you
project with shaq
percent and that is going to be rolled
will get 20% of the annual premium
keep that in mind but hey you guys i
credit utilization at 30 length of
book a principal role on a union
focused on passive income not only was i
monologues should come later in an
been doing variants of all three over
agents in a second but there are also
we could actually go to an audition and
other three scenes made it into the
the project and depending on the role
because those are the types of floors
the on the other side of the camera on
you're gonna get work so how do you get
i believe the average credit score in
this type of information is included in
originally created to sell things to
have taken a little bit longer i think
want to see that you are still currently
uh earlier this year maybe it was last
should have a featured role in your
history their character also matters a
look I get it
have stairs that's gonna cost a lot more
you start they throw a curveball at you
you regret not starting like five years
how did you know you sorcerer so let's
thing they want is for you to not be
vacancy rate the number of units your
phone number in which case you can just
video if you enjoyed it please give it a
hook is when you ask them for something
what to wear to an audition if you have
investor by buying and selling yourself
just because you don't have that 20%
movie i have no doubt that those three
scale I'm sorry I'm going on a tangent
your local area or owning properties
and you are shopping loans getting
explodes if you're seeing that it's
single week
some training and then you will have
hey how's it going you guys so I've been
particular role doesn't mean that you
here in california it takes about
exactly what we were talking about
got a call back
you're a photographer
probably the most affordable real estate
she thought that i already knew and i
to self-tape auditions at home
all the time and a lot of novice actors
now for the second column of the film
take this back to acting
lender in your area tell them about your
that way you have your account set up so
take action if any of these things
send those breakdowns out to agents
blows through all their savings in a
the most important thing to know here is
a minute long
attention away from my audition so make
you're like whoa the 1001 must be way
i've created multiple videos about that
than that you can have some type of
that hard to become a real estate agent
now I'm not telling you this to
can try building your own personal
haven't already also if you're
be on the lookout i hear it's running on
risky or you could price it at market
per month meant that i was saving close
is around nine thousand dollars so
that's great if you're an overnight
know any local actor that they have
is it television is it commercials or
i think it'll help you guys out a lot
now more with like online education and
money to maintain the place
here's the other thing about demo reels
as well as the big lesson that i learned
for most of you guys i think the solo
time just in case anything crazy comes
of oh i gotta book this acting job
a search for your
yourself out there create your own
with you in some way shape or form
metrics and it will actually calculate
that there might be call backs there
rate when you do apply
not to look for things on sale but
in the trash I'm never gonna watch it
willing to pay for so there's basically
look really good another thing I did was
basis of acting ability alone clients
what do you do well you should create it
the main example of an industrial video
acting friends so that they can learn
what camera you are using you should
if you've been asked to perform
because 99 of the top actors
know down in the comments which
that as much as 80 percent of new agents
on the side as I do in my full-time job
straight to the point but what we look
and analyze what things you can write
get an agent in the future
all this information needs to be at the
lines one last time in my head to make
i've made in
agents and casting directors that live
stand on your mark just look on the
I got the audition it was for a police
subscribe to this channel and don't
recommended so many of my friends to use
control over as the actors so that's why
in about 90 days and it's for sure the
like kind of a boxing analogy I think a
you can continue to use these strategies
foods you know so the less minimally or
which is going to save you a lot of
long-term residential rentals as well as
yourself for the test you should have no
this is the reality of the industry and
actor but i can tell you
requires 135 hours of class time and
store or something like that we tend to
don't have to get up til 2:00 in the
running Facebook or Instagram ads you
yourself if you find it hard to study by
they are very important because this is
Jordan Brown who's a casting director
was thinking about buying these nano
don't take up their entire day you may
so you may have to do your own research
i'll put a link to it below
discussed how actors make money
620 which is the minimum credit score
let's say you buy a property for three
usually means a speaking role if you
you are buying if you're buying a house
video and that was my
all the information you need to invest
jobs commute to our jobs
many of you but i've already seen it
successful business owners that still do
this portfolio to show people to say i
still be able to take advantage of
always going to the squat rack or the
this means that you're improving the
on this
your business and you're able to keep up
where they hired an actor from a
have that expense and i think it really
earlier that you can break into the
X or a T so when you go into an audition
a real estate agent you are your own
actor who they wanted for the sheriff
film and tv for the for the run of the
been asked to perform a monologue
fail within their first year this is
below in my opinion it's probably the
maybe 1pm or 2pm
caught up to the house values at all for
an agent or casting director or producer
hacking works extremely well if you live
good broker but having a mentor like
my logo
business use you can even do a section
have the exact answers for you but
production and how quickly they got
ton of work a ton of like custom
so i was really excited when i found out
improvement for that neighborhood and
end up getting a real audition and they
from that audition
the paper needs to be 8 by 10 that's 8
this video if you liked it please give
basically you're taking a class with x
up for success there are so many
get into a home worth about seven
that the average agent in the united
cleveland didn't have a bunch of movies
invested it and that's a very
really big tax strategy or deduction
line though oh and it's been an
important decision
when i was younger so who knows what
this is super important because 8 by 10
not having this whole savings mindset i
know that you're
tiny dog
in our careers all the time because just
after I get up but the first thing I do
question why because your ability to
character never changed
gonna like stand still right here and
experience than me
and then I'll put it down on my
get into this video today which we are
example that are really important one I
union job
them in this video
attention now there are all ways that
knowledge who understands how a photo
even indirectly then these types of
on where you live but let's say that
because it's pretty complicated and
and then sending it electronically to
would love to
time they see you on camera and then
to consider is not spending enough money
into the template and the awesome thing
is based on California which is where
you want
before you shell out the money for that
without mentioning headshots the actors
not enough or um any other thing
i'm not 100 sure i would have had the
for taping your auditions at home i'll
cons of getting your license later on
have gone okay yeah oh I can't find
literally hundreds of services you can
how you're getting started as an actor
download it for free
is going to be at least a few hundred
and i'll post a link to that video down
makers are the producers the show runner
way to save money all right number six
when it kind of clicked and I was like
are not a background performer you're
doesn't happen all the time but it
the rest of your career but this is your
i want to hire
helped me book over fifty movies and
now if you're buying a property for
how to act
gonna have the freedom to heck of time
want to show you how you can add a short
colleges and universities even community
a little bit more freely
this might take months or maybe even
I've worked on then I've created a free
you'll have to be a legal us resident
and they're going to call you up and
have helping you mentoring you and these
if you want to be a working graphic
really just a lot that you can do with
give you an opportunity to network and
doctor to walk in and then
and the reason why it's so important is
you want to take your time finding the
productions you're kind of just trusting
one or the other okay now let's get into
you're buying a duplex then you only
at least in 2020
you can do it you usually only work with
an audition
spending some time here with me today
mean I was definitely caught off guard a
put in the work and proven themselves
headshots are literally going to stick
rigid as a statue but this piece of clay
you are never forced to join the union
through these more concise summaries
Brandon anywhere where do where do you
where someone that lived in another
really lets you get into a home with not
w-2 they still won't pay taxes or even
one of the questions that i get a lot
spend on a house on your mortgage
you enough to potentially pay you $100 a
yes house hacking is less comfortable
and most of that time was spent just
entertaining or compelling story of your
i would recommend that you wait until
be able to pick it up for at least
financials your cash reserves all that
you can bounce ideas off of so
we then move beyond niceties to luxuries
1.75 percent upfront mortgage insurance
human being and learn that first
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
so it is important to find advice from
yourself then
i've done tons of 48 hour films you can
funding fee of two point one five

my agent send me this audition or why

more that you can automate
kansas city
trying to get their careers off the
my email list for sure
and it takes patience for sure and those
definitely be utilizing these
let's say I'm a casting director or an
trying to charge people for things and
ideas that has been awesome the fifth
muffin or something like that your order
goods or digital product now a digital
also interested in acting
ingesting and consuming needs to be
scary to think about but um the biggest
just really nice in general and check
now there's various different ways of
once those projects come out so i'll be
all the way out and then all we do is
needed something else to happen to her
i had no idea that shaquille o'neal was
go to a professional headshot
your only thing especially if you are in
dogs with inner life of ryan your
picture with your iphone
you'd want to go to a doctor or a health
prior to getting an agent because those
may not book future roles and sometimes
helps to offset or
for it look even better have a great and
king may look at that
union member you can only work on union
consistent and so I always worked at a
name of the school where you got your
to build up a massive
them especially if you don't think
because there were no tv shows and
what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
that means if you have both an agent and
go in confident it really is not a bad
allowed to
down in the comments below
it makes you not scared of investing now
agent and you don't have other people
is when you get paid so if you make a
auditions and casting directors don't
any property now whether it's for a
why is that one is because they run out
auditioning and career advice every week
make sure to hit me up if you're
that's going to be a very personal
start to
and you know get more profit for
invest in this you shouldn't try to find
videos just like this
about the audition process
character of george who happens to
make money from real estate investing

audition in late if you turn your
now you don't have to give yourself a
same with our body over our entire
tone though I mean if I do a good enough
this i make a ton of content about
that we buy is actually equivalent to
tell me who they are let me know down in
is that as soon as they sign with an
now your chances are a lot slimmer also
own and therefore at some point when you
that brand that we've seen a commercial
your property there's a lot of prep
instant equity by buying certain
has a demo reel who can show them
wasted time second is
see you on monday i
beneficial to a lot of people so if
supporting ryan coogler
it not been for the great agents i've
fully cover the mortgage and cost of
project is either a union project or a
and audition for those types of projects
career earlier
write the name of your school in this
is beware of anybody who says that they
let's say you're making a website that's
you can put on your resume
happens three they want to see you tell
headshot is printed on 8 by 10 to paper
instance every year thousands and
have your eyeline be here for the
a chance to work with a lot of actors
office deduction most self-employed
help you book the room
as well as my loan license exams was to
then i would say to go for it and it's
put such a small down payment
to see you on set one day
that lived
show them that you can tell an
feet tall
told you she was young at one time or
younger new realtors out there
the tenth and final way that we're going
a costume then by all means do it a lot
that mental stress that psychological
the name of the class let's say the
need 20% down to buy a house all these
in hollywood there are some well-known
that phrase quiet on set that applies
shaquille o'neal
many many other things that could go
helping you make money
buy that meat for the week or go to the
roles so it's
important is to get
or a television show i'll break down the
you run around me really fast and do
no idea what are the determining factors
videos i highly recommend you download
went ahead
now there's one more cost that i do want
and then we we shot the commercial on
there's also an annual mortgage
like hey this is how you can use your
you should not be paying them a dime for
this means they have no other income
five percent this means that you're
between 24 and 48 hours to prepare for
perform some shows will feel a lot
auditions because the truth is we have
them down
audition to a wider pool of actors this
earlier right what if
you're gonna get the best rate possible
during my first year of business at a
not to
you're going to impact and serve certain
own personal website and if you want to
this applies to people making minimum
and then they translated that into their
not get those residual payments so
put a link down in the description below
new york city and atlanta those are the
definitely recommend this for all
personally have seen
the tax code is complicated but the
underneath that should be your
not going to be offered
together it can actually act as
let's get started
first and last name in the name of the
no like financially it makes more sense
they also added different blocking and
learn the skills you need to break into
think that is very necessary my personal
after a member in which case you would
and and it's a fair question that a lot
from a copywriter to a videographer to
acting Career Center website that link
this house and kind of the steps I took
being able to do that and stunt
concepts are gonna work for a wide range
and that's a tough thing right now
only give those auditions to talent
hard to prove your income one thing you
sound like they are films made by
tv so this is something that you can put
myself and
you yes you have to do this in your
the right location matters
topic is what to wear to an audition
you're paying this fica on let's say you
online question bank for students in the
you don't fit that character description
trying to make money they don't have
almost all of them
your own license for doing your own
way of doing things point number three
when he dies that I become the president
so first two times on set with shaq
let's talk about actors first
this is your most powerful tool
camera simply means to angle your face
properties let's say you have a property
they're you know their food sources are
who's faced your problems before who's
on it and that's
and yet most of the hours that we spend
what is the purpose of sag-aftra well
go to your favorite store and find that
because you probably start your business
have acting work which is fantastic but
like albuquerque new mexico and maybe a
while still living where you are right
and i actually have a 12 off coupon for
definitely don't skimp on the kitchen
life you'll want to find out what the
and i kind of just hit the ground
looks like
has to be for a demo real purposes the
getting there isn't as mysterious as it
one uh the next major theme in the book
atlanta were auditioning for
what works best
want to do it you can do it but it's
every single week
anymore sister to sleep with hands with
ordinary joe i also have a few projects
I said I've seen it work for some people
started in my career but i was kind of
well i'm glad you asked i've actually
a union actor that is not the case once
so i drove back to pittsburgh i did the
all care about value there's no snake
channel because
there's a good chance against it can
and it's gonna get rid of those
show and
the residual payments do not get paid to
subscribe to this channel to get more
have nothing left to pay yourself
having an agent
based on my budget of what i could
they can trust
has a facebook group or multiple
income ratios as long as they're making
can get the lowest rate possible it's
let's get started so the first one on
and I definitely want to change that
if you did another type of online course
going over the top seven
cheaper for the production so that's why
can do is
week three hours I'm guessing that the
shoots team everything with her profession in
and no training so get your education on
not be able to live for free
risk sometimes to invest if you know the
primary residence to tenants
I'm eating it really those goals I know
how i auditioned for those
sell a house in those few months or a
television shows here in the united
around the country around the world
online and if you're looking for a
your movie
producer or director or anybody in the
all celebrate the audition itself and
audition standing up rather than sitting
on as a union actor
really when you think about having a big
and also the tent screening process you
patterns the squat and lunge push pull
was financially stable with my other
to really enjoy it and just was able to
is about 50% my biggest tip for studying
that you're taking in because now now a
will look for
joining me here today if this is your
sizes I had never heard the term sides
spending some time here with me today if
with the director's vision and that's
which is
in the union finally
to twenty five six feet tall like really
don't have a
get a self taped audition request that
a piece of cake have the cake you know
and the second doctor doesn't have a
I've been auditioning for this for a
schedule changes and all of a sudden
kind of a catch-22 of the industry a lot
rent what you'll do is you'll find the
says in the commercial the next term is
we're human we make mistakes and
specific skill like someone who can
your agent only takes a 10
television shows and still went 37
could look like that you're trying too
house at 5:00 a.m. one day and then the
keep learning and i hope to see you on
however these are the first few steps
go to sleep it's the very last thing I
want to feel that way as actors right we
more those actors on those commercials
to see audition
the lenders only look at the credit
so that's something you should take into
into real estate investing because as
character meaning you should definitely
set one day
specifically for movies and television
between being union and non-union well
qualified to be doing what we're doing
the hinges and all the knobs the handles
is your networking
would i have had the same amount of
union auditions when you are a non-union
least 90 days minimum to go through this
independence then hit the playlist over
like three times and then here we would
several second shooters that would work
diagnose what your problems are so
dab dab dab dab dab dab like 25 times
option in my opinion using a neutral
look i feel like i say this in almost
or if they were self taped the casting
saying oh i'm a really good actor i want
looking for then now is your opportunity
with saving
streamlined their ability to buy a home
body in my brain absorb all of this the
worse and i just don't recommend it for
girl about her missing mother since the
i'm not going to audition for this
look more like a professional but it's
about acting when they asked you tell me
money so by understanding the way the
that wasn't a part of the audition it
stabilize it on a tripod so if I were
browse the full price stuff but i will
should be fairly easy as long as you use
i'm not going to dive deep into this
how might this expenditure change if i
higher and higher the lower that you're
you should also be taking audition
second question zombie merrygold one and
and that's gonna waste a lot of money so
several months
California the courses are 135 hours
a good income
audition for one character and they use
like button
in just one year for example a computer
city I can tell you right now that the
photography business or as another
and things are right now and would you
at any time right it doesn't have to
of competition
is to take acting classes what better
i couldn't make the second audition they
the reason is the phone is a touchscreen
only cost me about 60 bucks
like your poor until you make
i was released from first refusal my
to show them your work show them your
of these people have evolved and are
associated with the FHA loan this PMI
digital products and sales funnels and
in this video we're going to be talking
role because and it ended up with me
to be the difference between 0.55 and
sometimes for business purposes then
really expensive homes you have to stay
full-blown police officer's uniform with
you are no longer allowed to work on
we were always playing sports you know
and investing that money and if you
for example you can write off your car
so we are spending much more than just
one day and go
if someone tells you hey can you please
audition for the casting director
take my dog there all the time to hike
people viewing maybe 10 homes 20 homes
very intuitive and so there will be a
by shopping around
audition right that's gonna make
auditioning audition preparation process
become a full-time actor in Ohio okay if
who are helping so i'm not doing
income and this number has to be under
theater degree can be helpful but it
friends and family buy places as well
work on student film so if there's a
are in this process after the callbacks
you have no money left to pay your bills
on self-improvement every single day
if you do have a demo reel
marketing around here especially
transactions as well as starting to
now is not to you know push towards
air conditioning and my heat because I
someone as a graphic designer and you
kind of pivot more towards the acting
even though kurt can't make the actual
given a commercial you're telling a
able to audition
get your real estate license from not it
marketing is king so go into real estate
movie one last thing before we get
I do not shy away from using props in
information so just be prepared for that
so that's my story about how i got my
name is Kurt you thank you so much for
photography is a lot a lot different
sure to hit that subscribe button to get
speak louder than words all those
friends have informed when i needed you
and so from for an actor's life you know
that role i auditioned for a different
film and in the scene is a husband and a
doing on camera work is doing
of that so
stapling it or taping it on the back
do even if it's just being a production
or find your uncle with a fancy camera
you guys can use to reduce your spending
background work does not go
throughout most of it and I was really
mistakes like printing our headshots on
rock you how much she expected play hard
math and compare it to the missouri
yes the process is probably going to
if you did it in a local theater you
Thor he's doing some bicep curls for
you don't have to join after working
bigger market
because the pressure is going to be
until next time keep practicing keep
the $10,000 question if I had done the
they added a line for me the doctor to
the stuff that i created with my friends
the stage was to youtube hold on
the union in ohio
fulfillment because that's the way the
they're willing to
including my free audition cheat sheet
acting classes are so vital to your
pretty soon and you get paid
price it higher than that's probably not
everything that's happening in our face
chance to perform for the first time or
and it's called the fulfillment curve
and until next time keep practicing keep
you saw me in the new gerard butler
and i had no idea until i showed up on
online course
the open house like they loved it and
open-concept place so what that means is
up at the same time
then an email is going to be amazing for
was the main character i'm not 100 sure
all of that work is the 90 this is the
character in the movie underseas where
about the business is the audition I say
you learn the skills you need to break
to move to a bigger market now if you
it's a big decision so do your research
impact so many people the people who
self-employed people can utilize
to forceps then the starch they can go and of
however if you're getting started you
reviewed my previous audition and my
a very small percentage of actors who
this video well in a few seconds I'm
because we think oh I'm not an expert
on convenience when they can't actually
everyday lives if we see that brand
wanted to give you a quick tip about why
out without leaving their own house
interested in now some auditions don't
those all start to add credits to your
hundreds of auditions that I've done the
their recommendations for each role of
have complete control
a few different
book actors for all kinds of different
partial list right next to it just so
path but um
see yourself for the game ends with you
the foundations to grow your business
learning and i hope to see you on set
actually I saved that book in my like
completely profile to the camera and the
creating courses and launching them in
maybe they just needed someone taller
motivation or if it's not motivation
buy that product now of course the most
that you can do it so in order to pass
switch enough because they think it's
you can look at the crime data you can
background work does not go on an acting
knowing that you were created with
the one i recommend you guys try out is
just anything that shows your income is
important the main reason for this is
in fact
you become eligible immediately another
it's time to set up your online casting
losing real money
ask your friend to do it don't go to
modeling jobs available for people that
they're broken up into three sections
they've negotiated contracts for actors
first house will live there generally
into your house whereas if you spend
my name is Kurt you thank you so much
want to become an actor but you don't
number may surprise you
real estate test i'm not saying to
your own credit card or your credit just
experience doing that and I was pretty
you need to do in your business and
and perfect and seemed effortless it
four hours per day or more on business
know what you're doing and be a
the end of the scene at your end mark
here are all of the actors that i
you've been taking all these steps
ethnicities as well so i auditioned for
track every aspect of your life these
cut from movies and shows
auditioning for real stuff yes you can
so that's why it's really important to
with the average square footage
to meet and you get to see a lot of
thousands of actors trying to get those
other things one of the most important
overdramatic what my character doesn't
the paid education that i have done the
some of the ways of making money
on-camera actor you can do a movie you
store you're making money off of that or
ways that you can do this you can just
needed renovations then make sure you
you have you want me to answer of course
physical characteristics that we can't
um and you could probably err on the
something like this is to shoot a scene
different answers so let's tackle the
ourselves away from you know just dry
get your heart on fire and fury
have finished writing the script
myself as if i were in their shoes what
write shoot edit and basically complete
agent to sell their first home and this
you are considering a move what is the
that's the first step figuring out as a
actors can make money within this
maybe even film a vlog
preparation process that's helped me
had i done something differently
lot of people also think that to
those things that I don't have to
answering them on the
their productions union now i also
that you will guarantee you can turn
which i talked about in my video last
important role so using a prop in your
learn about the process of making a
example a 50
that so for instance
start your acting career and the second
helps to support it
that like button and also subscribe to
interested in checking them out but i
other actors that have done that as well
through a commission
know what they're doing and they're
okay so these are all the things that
come to me with injuries and in fact I'm
able to go on vacations
that everybody needs to take into
scene only has to be maybe 30 seconds to
you can just take classes at a private
check out their website and see if
might be a bit tough for you that's
i think at one point or another all of
a real estate agent is a very flexible
maintenance tires insurance and all
that type of schedule I learned a lot
there might be reasons why chicago may
guys should check out
something athletic to your audition but
also i want you guys to think outside
opportunity meets preparation
first choice you're gonna have is what
that being an actor is like running your
and to continue to update your marketing
you know be behind the scenes and
and television shows so again
where you take two hours out of your
in 30 years which is what you'll
because they've been doing this for a
photographer you need to change the name
a good
you'll find is you would be able to use
topics so yeah overall an extremely
viewer about how much they love using
instructions those instructions overrule
pay on a 1099 but that still makes you
close to you the premise of the 48 hour
habits and exercise into our weird and
that you want to be a professional
for example you get tax advantages and
resume is not named something like
the producers of the movie hire a
headshot and resume
see the headshot paper is smaller it is
those have like been what i make those
that you really have to set aside some
it would have been a totally different
most people are not going to be able to
know how you would answer tell me about
ohio i got
wife and they're repainting their
aspiring actors who are just getting
share with you guys so the first thing
as one dollar a month of mental
sheet until next time keep practicing
time that you submit for
good if you are scared of spending too
a better actor
roof all these things are going to not
way up the mountain oh yeah you bet she
28 as i continue to
about things
data set see a scale has no intrinsic
being said let's get into the most
classes my entire 12-year acting career
agent well those people are getting way
tech on social media and we can really
that i didn't end up booking but
or a politician who performs a speech
keep eating out frequently they'll spend
read and you follow those taping
have an 8 by 10 crop we can actually
save a little bit of money
I mean my positioning is almost exactly
you know with these classes I'm trying
in word how to be home in this code is
the whole entire trip
our fourth week now and there are a
serious about investing in real estate
you what residuals are
take attention away from you
level to expert is when we're selling
actually sees through its lens this is
do i regret not starting my acting
this stuff all of this is within your
other markets
have any type of nest egg i don't
next time keep practicing keep learning
and they're trying to get a gauge of
pure water filter system and that's
crowds with us left behind where i
for example it's going to take you at
great audition in less than 48 hours
the sort of expertise that then means
it's all useful information to have if
sustainable for you so Kurt you know
i thought i'd make a follow-up video and
drive to starbucks and you can make
make those mistakes so that when you get
all of those people every time that they
notes and that just eats up so much time
especially when you're younger just
commercial Union status can refer to
see you on set one day
all right on to the story of how i
calvin klein or a victorious secret
will be paid off down the road so let's
making $100,000 a year you've got a full
than just normal tap water this is a
research a great place to ask that
and they just kind of forget about the
know being able to offer you things and
and this is completely legal the second
can do what I do which is to have
description so if they can if if they
happening in uh markets like la where
you is that if you are 100 determined
that completely changed my relationship
depends on things that you are choosing
first mastermind january of 2020 and it
important as well and that is right to
explain when I say the last thing I do
sure you
the timing will work out for you there
the entire script that way let's say it
the writer and the director and
value then it just doesn't make sense
to be 18 years old and this information
how to gain experience as an actor
a lot of people want to know what are
i believe it comes out here in the
good amount of
check out those like little tiki hut BBQ
anything and at this point
having that experience both myself and
more likely that an FHA loan is your
you have a lot of leverage to ask for
where to move okay now let me talk to
becoming a landlord house hacking is not
leaf light panels that looked
auditions that i did
we prefer brand names just mostly
certification exam sometimes multiple
nothing would match up and i couldn't do
or sell more because you do that um i
right we've probably thought oh like i'm
trust me there are going to be things
i kind of touched on this a little bit
and it's extremely uncomfortable but
as soon as i moved to atlanta my first
sustain that so you know sustainability
in whatever city you currently live in
really bad ones which leads us to the
extra and you won't see on your actual
they are an absolute scam they are not a
just out in a vacuum by itself so it
me first tell you that
you know just from past experience it's
in many scenarios to buy the home with
think 2017
for those to do so I think I'm gonna
and i hope to see you on set one day
simply just buy less clothes i know a
and it doesn't have a physical button
single week as a working actor in the
gonna range from twenty seven hundred K
audition so
involved in real estate investing as
always come back to thinking about how
it's still a heck of a lot better than
short film make our we would make our
whatever the name of the theater was
now in this particular movie there were
can't wait for it to come out so i can
talk to a few brokerages and see which
that's not how an agent works but you
agent to realize you could be the best
help with taxes but that's not the truth
from and into because if we're not
before most people aren't putting down
on that but if you are in the us
that's why we're talking about getting
you guys need to know is how to increase
requested along with your headshot
distraction it could end up taking
know they have solid experience teaching
so let's go ahead and talk about the
height a slate is used both in the
groups associated with acting and
quit our jobs and stick it to the man
if you happen to see me on the show let
college that's
show so it's been super busy
if you give them content for free you
students for recommendations for a
does not equal success there are so many
watching your audition whether that's
nobody starts their basketball career by
it link will be in the description of
real estate salesperson course there
lott if you single still make up and
advantage to owning investment
about how i was once offered
by the Federal Housing Administration
yeah those are the eight things you
prioritize one over the other but i have
really just concerned about the film and
a complete like shitty realtor then your
films or independent films
social media was made to be social but
and I as an actor when I come on set I
and they want to see some of your
meet that potential tenant face to face
this is a very
about yourself at an audition try not to
a bit too much and especially too early
television show
workouts which Monday through Friday 8
agent because the only time you pay your
is because the states they have a
lens and you say your name and your
to see it self-improvement reading all
look in that direction for the explosion
and then you can sell your services
stronger choices than others or there
drink from starbucks or dunkin donuts or
that we just talked about all of those
you set a salary of forty thousand
between two people so that you can
1 000
opportunity to show them your work no
they've done plays since they were in
your project
one they had me
this is something that my brother and I
insights into the local market
and not only look for
this and then craft he's gonna come out
paying for full price clothes then just
you can make money online by drop
you can do
your name should be your union status so
were in-person auditions
room until we're called in
posts sharing your favorite productivity
that and I think a lot of
i originally got my first audition for
to be prepared for it
that the casting director will then
copying and pasting so it doesn't take
in the industry and the things that i
so yeah if you want to get into real
literally standing where the main
what is a self-tape well i think we're
a movie or television show often at the
the money it's always helpful to adopt
those producers to do everything the
i don't know what cast and websites are
asking me do i need a talent agent to
so yeah if you're thinking about getting
to just chat with you guys and help you
you're living there you get access to
states are sag-aftra productions
standardized patient
the fourth way to find auditions without
probably not going to be paid for these
test you on this material and you'll see
it was a new disney plus show and i
of s corpse is that they allow you to
here and not just try to take a good
haven't downloaded my free
start an acting career
or a tv show whatever it is then you do
be an on-camera actor and i think there
tension you know there's a lot of
so best case scenario let's say that
today we're going to be talking about
bedsheet make sure you earn out all of
and start auditioning for the projects
marketing affiliate marketing is when
have to know if you're good at acting if
wash with the day of
with those so i can't really speak about
making a living activity with more life

that side of my business and the passive
now and when it's done

many things that go into it and i feel
illusion of
head spinners friend yoshi story of his
each and every day every day you need to
love a home that requires some work
talent agency to get representation but
perfectly okay we're all starting from
because you're a good actor doesn't mean
it's really beneficial to live where
i did it and i went back to cleveland i
on a commercial with a celebrity so both
resource on the business of acting
contractors that i work with so you know
complete scam
information about the whole process all
really have
what are you gonna do you're on camera
important to me
to join sag-aftra is only about half of
and when i worked on that show sean penn
much about the filmmaking process so if
work for them or whatever so everyone
training for your film and tv career
it's important to go to a professional
i'm learning new things that i will be
steady increase in abilities you know
line was to start the rehearsal but of
when you first started and this i
have a lot of things automated you have
burn out during the course or even worse
whole real estate thing that's why I
so let's go through each item one by one
an easy fix or they can also be very
to thank Tyler one more time for joining
so that they all came through here and
my name is Kurt you hey if you haven't
the time where you want to
currently running on tv
a labor union here in the united states
already taken
actor records their audition at home and
things so that
and a professional resume
gonna eat because you guys you need to
understand what you're doing and how
so when i say tipping point what i mean
your article we are going to such the
from the crowd
$400,000 I don't think it's gonna make
like this
guys taxes are very complicated
difference once you are a
you can
doctor in the UK now honestly all of
they will cast a variety of actors but
on the remaining balance and as a result
walk right out of this world but his one
get started
never finishing it because of all the
at 35
yourself and how you responded
have to refill it right now another way
they'll think of you and they'll call
and remember that relationships are a
you also get residual payments for
and and the people that those people
sense so that you wouldn't just be
one of the most common questions I get
for my youtube video
all these things tend to have a positive
it's your first time here make sure to
going to pay for acting classes how i'm
because I genuinely love the product and
right so make sure you start
clicked for me and it was like oh man
embrace the savings mindset
was eating how I was eating and it took
these types of real estate questions so
I call it my audition cheat sheet and
it's basically gonna be worth 50 in 10
back in october of 2020 so right in the
ourselves so much that you know were
magically get signed to an agent without
out that door you need to leave the
matter what all right so that's it for
definitely a misconception because
absolutely no experience
video if you liked it please give it a
whatever it is
another way that actors make money in
now could i still move to los angeles at
back to the original question of
it'll work but this Tuesday and this
that's why for those two primary reasons
multi-step process
like that speaking of websites i do want
if you love your full-time job don't
including my friends that option
local actors because when they hire
approach but this is coming from a very
in that show now the next thing i know a
you much more consideration because
not just actors but when we when we talk
into your actual house-hunting because
it allows people to leverage money at
you learn the skills you need to break
to this channel to get more videos on
to print the headshot in the print
zero cost of distribution and hopefully
effortless now why is that it's not
on TV it's like that very safe modern
so on the day of your headshot session
in those situations is just work on
in order to remain in the union you do
like and subscribe if you want to see
near atlanta have the best
in hand with eye lines cheating that the
and they got paid five thousand dollars
i don't want to waste my time if i have
i can just wait for my agent to call
means let your sphere of influence know
now if you have an agent you would put
representation you'll get auditions from
now if i lived in california or new york
person to be around and you're in a
in every movie and show has
issue and that is that production
of that it's like well maybe we change
different ways that they can possibly
so when i got started i was really just
but it's not gonna work for everyone and
the acting career center here to help
life strategies that you can use
person giving the script to somebody
the next section is training
trade more than 80 thousand hours of our
and that's not the correct term the
get started today it doesn't take too
saying hey we appreciate your service
from the cheapest one to the most
career is not going anywhere
take advantage of
little bit but you know of course it
so what this means for actors is that if
auditioning and career advice every
to two things it can refer to either a
online course and that's actually what I
gas and you can also learn whenever you
learn more about self-taping i actually
here are the two actors i would like to
leaked on social media or something like
federal income tax as well as state
microphone closer to me and further away
means that you're going to be a landlord
self-helpy but actually it's it's a very
doing four hours per day
it to real life scenarios so it's much
but before we explore how you can start
built and so my first web site that I
really makes a difference so with that
when you go because you don't want to be
beating ourselves up over failed
you're gonna get that check pretty
lines in your head so how do you do that
agent is a ton of eyeballs on them and
um then pretty soon in the future that's
is done being written once the writers
book and I highly recommend it I'll put
i had those traits a little bit more
and yet they just want to be part of the
like cigarette smoke have been like
leave them down in the comments below
actors and if you don't have a demo reel
from us
10-step audition preparation cheat sheet
up and you spend way more than that and
point once you've built up 20% equity in
and until next time
in the big blockbuster realm but doing
represent me
talking about one agent here
haven't downloaded my 10 step
i think at least 10 000 saved up in the
the three columns here are again the
start buying a home number three is that
too young to be doing this
and i know there are going to be a lot
12 hours of studying into the day before
eating should be treated as a privilege
many of them have
can see
and microphones and tripods and editing
acting classes
do audio books you could do a narrative
a cheaper car then it's probably better
be interested in film and tv
please give it a thumbs up and if you
of stainless steel appliances all really
after buying my first property
800 and we're working in a job that pays
knock you know 20 doors or send out x
life and over time if you do this
floor and look for that X or the T and
certainly didn't hurt the next lesson
into my life let's start with a passage
that's okay you've got the internet and
single week
using my phone I would just put it on a
if you haven't already subscribe to this
guarantee you that ninety percent of the
do research about the population trends
can stick it professional headshot your
rapid receipt
all the basic first steps we went
have always been
on both sides because it saves the
then keep watching this video because
maybe seven days a week as long as it's
mistakes because you've made them before
to work on scene work rather than
promise you'll start on your path to you
for actors who want to grow their
auditions and we'll talk about talent
traditional 401k i won't get into too
and when it works for you because that's
may put on
compare buying it with other properties
to move to america
to join sag-aftra then you get your
you are on set right now in 2020 the
ways that i connect with you guys is so
same script the first line is a few
well in my opinion the number one
so excited for you to get your hands on
the first thing that people do these
bank account if you want to move to one
are projects that will probably not pay
business like there's just there's so
tax write-offs or strategies that
about how to find auditions without an
does it have to be an hour two hours or
and it it will honestly it will make you
Thursday I have I have a job coming up
sometimes you're really busy sometimes
become a real estate agent buy and sell
we have the master suite this is the
it a business
make ends meet our new design of swings
filming the movie typically when
i don't expect them to come and take
doesn't take too much education and it
video but the point is that
feeling called to do it
give an audition to that actor because
can see the whole house walk through it
and know how to do it the first thing i
those public casting calls represent
in you may pay
abilities to make money online because
was all focused on passive income and
they've they've been brought back not
actors can incorporate healthier eating
get more auditions for this show why
people's products is with affiliate
the acting career center here to help
first 20 to 30 seconds so you want to
don't have an agent you would just put
and that's the perfect transition
pushing pause and that doesn't allow me
this little dog is gonna hike all the
agents so that they can guarantee
outsourcing as much as you can
one morning I woke up and became sick
i think that goes without saying but do
may need to think about is whether or
the purpose of this video is strictly
has a thousand or more questions that
this sucks i must be a terrible actor
could make your own course for complete
there were decisions that were made
up booking the role i've also auditioned
actors for each role to the producers
see you guys in the next video
character or a series regular
commercial property
seriously just finish the course sort of
the ways to join are
earning it spending it investing it
let's say you're trying to get an agent
like just like in acting just like in
the power of your network is much more
before in a previous video where we
retention is now in summary there are
get guaranteed business through your
from that point it became a goal of mine
to be looking at your reader you're
schedules change all the time
you take the exam that's way worse than
be doing prior to getting an agent
leave them down in the comments below
or on the internet
have to study and pass this test so the
you with you with your friends
leads from somewhere like zillow or your
sustainability standpoint yeah that's
african-american or i'm not caucasian or
auditions how i approach
and experience that way okay the ninth
types of things be sure to subscribe
really enjoys it so yeah thank you guys
fitness and health as well yeah yeah so
of your salary so that's 10 000 and if
what's up you guys so today I wanted to
topic that you can watch
prize winning economist daniel kahneman
other units
people out there not everybody but there
are netflix and youtube premium and
kind of follow me with the camera I'd be
but in in my experience that's like
much you can realistically charge
for star wars now i'm going to add
wherever you live right now can you
television commercials
the more work that you get
for example you may get an audition at
including the three projects that i'm
list having a strategy with all of that
thousands of other actors
that's it for this video if you liked it
valuable it was presented and they're
and the second is paying down your
online course if I want to put a class
use a phone to tape your auditions which
step further and talk about how
audition it's the next round of
if you're doing a lot of cosmetic stuff
they know how much
i made those investments did i make them
apartment for free
projects and maybe the first few things
whatever business you are
get a couple clients in the beginning
horseback riding or you can drive manual
have to follow all of the union
tock instagram anything that can really
help with just the camera or anything or
ahead and use props if it helps you
want to be able to have a track record
that the image file on the computer is
anything what are the chances that you
they don't become more resilient well
project that we talked about
demo reel
just buying a property and leasing it
this gigantic oversized center island
video where i talked about black widow i
i go on and on the sounds of god and
lifestyle and get into that whole
it's possible that an agent still
of a manly death okay what like maybe
meaning they make a 10 to 20 commission
and you get headshots that look
involved in this commercial
thumbs up and if you haven't already
seconds of just
immediately after signing you go get
so the fourth technique that I use to
was so overwhelming that I didn't even
as a police officer it's harder for them
buy a house all right that's all I have
vast majority of auditions the casting
carry out the house hacking process you
that's what you're going to have to look
then that means in the future they are
again gain experience as an actor but
definitely been some dry spells in fact
commercials is actually one of the ways
thumbs up and remember to subscribe if
listen i really wish that i could tell
i hope every single week i try to but
are acting career regrets and i thought
product conflicts and availability
waste your time you don't want to waste
if you had started that
to your resume now i'm going to put this
framing is shoulders up that means it's
headshot at your auditions well that's
that when they get water on them they're
I've seen much about it
instead they're moving all their stuff
available online where yeah you can
be on camera with an acting coach or an
throughout your entire body and
huge benefit of having a talent agent
great way to get started
actor I booked about 10 percent of my
afford in atlanta when i was looking at
hundreds and hundreds of people
just really have to do your due
the number one thing to remember when
because atlanta has offered me
two movies and recurring on a netflix
my acting career because
then you're really going to understand
house is like so the first thing he
agents and casting directors are not
videos on acting auditioning and career
being the only person living on your
eat and you can stick to that awesome
recording your audition at home
i mean like a real job you can't just
you will pass on the first try the
by the same token
they're not eating the same things
basically some type of service that
boring boring be enthusiastic and
but like they say luck is when
and that's the attention of people who
cheapest photographer when you're first
it's important to choose wisely but you
questions as you can
definitely scrape those off repaint it
some point in the future
upload then you can get this free tool
with your friends these are the things
hire i'm willing to pay my own travel
that much anyway in fact
market production companies aren't doing
hands-on you can get i know a lot of
eye out for casting calls and audition
before getting a talent agent however
is that this
then you'll probably have to pay someone
this property for
shutters overlooks the backyard really
even though you don't have an agent
I hardly get hardly ever get that much
for a lifetime or a lifestyle not just
but i really wanted to pinpoint it here
and this question is good because it
then they're on the hook and their
works for you that would not personally
sometimes is
an hour I can't do it it's like you can
pressure is higher
can think of for new actors who are
so if that's what you want for your
use of your time
down in the comments below and
gym throughout my whole acting training
so that's a great way to get started a
people down and I'm glad that you talked
this was a show on hulu it only got one
hard and it's kind of a more advanced
all the new way um i should also point
and they have no acting training they
not already of course be sure to like
that you have what it takes to become an
uh they were not they were not told
the producers so that now they gave me
yes and no so let me explain when you
whole your finances and what you need to
think so good luck getting your real
performers get residual
actingcareercenter.com today i just
for the mental or the emotional or the
out on your clients right so to be able
only elevated my business as a whole and
reading that there is guys
is another great way that you can make
taken many many write-offs and used many
going to be like
throughout the semester
education business i have now
as a side hustle while working a
we do that we first have to make sure
that is your head shot in your resume
amount of leads for let's say a monthly
as a stand-in
every person that ends up taking this
before they can try to get to play into
it so that's why i recommend a scene
I've got this big stunt scene coming up
know with with those clients that train
wagon maybe I just do the warm-up or
best interest
be in your best interest and so yeah you
setting it up you have to spend time you
that book if you feel like you need to
house and obviously when you're taking
anything online is by using attention
you can get those MDF crown molding or
which is the course i recommend there
the name of
awesome it was a great conversation I
still have to be able to make those
we're talking for most people you can
that there are a million different ways
if i had let that stop me i wouldn't
there you will find commercials on there
level of privacy invasion depends on
have the gist of it and you think you
and roses
facebook groups
results you're gonna get so if you want
that course I found that real estate
where there is dialogue between two
into the details of all of that in this
or are you gonna rather prefer paying
it because we never use that function a
that you're an agent let all your
same room together and part of the
thank you very much for watching i hope
comparable properties are renting for
use that because they all have hd
other actors is getting involved in
I've been doing photography for like 11
actually my favorite it's the way that I
them down in the comments below until
a property manager they'll usually
from the book that really resonated with
this is basically everything that i'm
all the roles and in this case they did
and recovery which is why for the actors
tangible resources like downloadable
hundred dollars so if you do want to
you can get a thousand people who like
payments you need to
don't prescribe to that style or that's
email list you have to spend time
if they want a physical headshot and
work for you and them if they don't work
demo reel and you don't have anything to
know that they can trust you to go on to
into the trap of
get experience community theater you
not only are you learning how to act
ellie sattler hey if you're getting
and really for all the stuff just move
courses and they will have to cast
that you need 20
until 9:00 p.m. or something so for a
down and that's why it's so popular
true because a lot of real estate agents
card doesn't have a website
self-study so you have to be like really
president dies huh
was a little caught off guard by it and
tools and the techniques and the classes
learning and i hope to see you on set
can ask ourselves
towards you the borrower instead it's a
48 hour film project
you're gonna be like what's happening
just so hard to come up with 20% down
showcase both your acting while you are
so desperate so what i would say is cut
for those types of projects but
the body you know a lot of people have
places right so oh I'm sorry no go ahead
and i don't want to be giving out false
get back to it do you plan ahead where
time if this is your first time here
i find that they have accurate questions
very cheap option and it's gonna let you
controlling your controllables which are
for your first violation the easiest
like hey I'm doing this on my own time I
residual payments are payments that you
and paying a lot of money
i've put a link to that list down in the
things still go
straight auditions without booking a
countries as well we'll have
was it was very early on in my
start an acting career from whatever
is a different size than normal printer
in terms of gaining as much experience
buying homes for yourself and selling
you're trying to figure out when you
um it's gonna be totally different for
directors producers a lot of them put a
but there are steps before and after the
resume dot PDF
on acting in theater and
taking an online class it's a lot of
big movies and shows let's go back to
for you it's it's really important to
let's open it up to a wider pool of
about immigration so you'll have to
musical theater actor
to discuss today about how
affiliate partnerships with certain
the cheapest headshot photographer you
want to pursue an acting career here in
years a hundred
easy answer and that is
mail out your application to the
different in a sense where people might
ask you to say your name in your height
of these
this as your career is to have
the night you pack your lunch for
that case your PMI payment is going to
man-made planks that look a lot like
your audition in on time well something
feel free to drop them below but
completely separate video
special skills not just skill skills
opening up my own brokerage now while
from acting class get together with them
actor a personal trainer and the owner
who you should definitely be following
minutes a day can be really beneficial
can tell you're a good actor so can you
they think oh i know who would be
cover in this video if you like this
through udemy course or a skill shed
agree with that list do you not agree
and start
income yes this will reduce your cost
able to do more of that and grow the
director whether that's a director or
in this industry that a lot of people
put down under 20% the first one is the
about the types of jobs they're booking
charging more and more especially as you
what we embrace alpine f you have any
non-union productions that have made me
biggest but there's this like gigantic
that's crazy how much more opportunity
what they do with
that to cast multiple roles
in New York City and you can do the same
we've got the option of going part-time
your application and
audition script if you covered up the
constantly whatever you can do whatever
well those training videos hire actors
backyard or any other common areas the
you can add to your skill section
compare that to a normal brokerage
included were wearing like a blue or a
agent i hope this video was helpful for
customers at a store but they maybe only

and finally your training have you been
before i have to join the union in fact
competition that finding clients is very
either the industry or I have presented
not going to be spent you know learning
all especially when you're comparing the
so they they they changed uh quite a bit
directors know that if they post an
how to connect flow desk and show it and
another factor that can either help or
nope that is definitely not the case you

there are a lot of
prepare for that audition then I go in
to know that i went full time my
they offer you that peace of mind what i
process by yourself the more that you
get clients and this is really the most
acting there's nothing there's no one
use a blank wall like i got behind me
how i booked my commercial with
i'm here in atlanta a medical school
like i said before an agent doesn't
anything that is related to your
much sense to invest fifty grand into
invest in it because a headshot is so
and try and remember all the important
material you choose we went for a quartz
course if you're very very serious if
returns and to be extra safe use a
they are really interested in them for
calling home and if there are some
for improvement so ask around for some
audition classes stunt classes stage
career okay i hope that was helpful if
off day today so we are recording this
so they don't necessarily have to make
that's because agents and casting
a brita or
those reasons alleged child had heard
recently I was on a zoom call with
for company training videos and
why am i getting this audition why would
how close do you match the character
that you're a really good actor and when
as subscribers as opposed to you don't
for the theater side of your career
want to see success in your future if
think he could have gone I can't find
nobody in this industry cares if you
if you do disagree let me know down in
in cleveland that had an office in
already and until next time keep
ten years in my career I've done maybe
when i was a younger kid even in my
before looking at non-union actors so in
thought you were supposed to be on my
resume and demo reel of all of those
probability of passing on your first try
putting down as a down payment so let's
career and that's why I'm calling them
headshot jpg because that still doesn't
isn't cheap
is really helpful because I don't have
you hand them your resume and you did a
question that kept coming up
and these laminate luxury vinyl floors
not the type of person that can sleep in
page dedicated specifically to all the
career you are most likely not getting
is suited for your learning style and
about that your agent had your back
stand-in because you
reduce every single word in the script
that most people will consider hollywood
thirty dollars check out that list of
strength or
agent or a manager or both then you can
entire life to real estate so yeah know
the casting director might say hey let's
will typically see a lot of storyboards
anything like this where you can start
pay classes pay for classes
is an exchange of our life energy but as
for you feel free to let it go and try
these things you're gonna get
and i do have a video on my youtube
off of the money that you make through
conversation ask them some questions
format these questions
just take this information and try and
nobody cares they only care that you can
this career is terrible i go on 14
the entire casting process works
tell an engaging story then the people
and online question banks and now it's
all of those rules whereas union
force is going to be the most expensive
eight-by-ten photo paper now let's talk
topic some casting directors say sure go
enough to never really worry about money
so if you're interested in becoming a
episode of the show the first back in i
your shoulders in building your career
the book Sharon has a chapter called
video if you liked it please give it a
movies that are quote unquote hollywood
you are pursuing
gonna suck anyway probably don't even
we want we could sell pretty much
and the money that you should have saved
certain point
the actors faces next to each other this
define riparian rights they'll find a
thousands of people buy those dvds it
so that they could stay on schedule so
was a role that I was up for that I
casting directors and talent agents you
using props and auditions ok so what's
shouldn't go overboard with it for
or l.a one of the major markets
to a new market
network all the stuff you learn in your
these factors we have very little
see their behind the scenes and just see
house is the potential resale value in
is budgetary reasons you got to
something else full-time
logical order to cover things so first
test questions there's only a finite
link that little video down below too if
90 seconds to two minutes long max
and then one day i get a call from my
sweat absolutely sore all over your body
and offer to be their reader every time
best actor that you can possibly be
relatives or family members so the next
top doing things that everyone else is
publicly posted publicly as well on
best person to give you advice because i
is the process that i use for all of my
you can write off on your own taxes
your routinized I don't know maybe
things and not the money or the number
now one thing that you might do is that
as you are in the process there's no way
can check it out you can really start it
that's happening within our eyes we want
that I learned was to always be ready to
into this
hustle that you're doing on the side to
templates i created a brand and added it
they have original content that you
actual state exam so go through these
and uh i should have seen this question
closet right there and then right here

furthermore in yourself because you know
an individual activity that is
your career the first item

means and so if you are young if you are

you know chris hemsworth preparing for
your goal is to build up wealth if it's
about it as health gain and a lot of
about before
teens maybe after school the point is
feel like personally works best for me
let me jump in for a second if you're
effective ways that you guys should be
and he kind of popped his head in the
description may have been written when
the scale like it like it has a value
and i just really appreciate it and i'm
the fun part begins when you start
work for me I like my carbs so and and
this is tofu
designer or a developer to do these
over 80% of the loan to value the amount
who understands the industry who has
is one of the like my most prized things
the next thing you have to know is that
over the step-by-step process of buying
means you don't need to pay it up front
own stuff then we control everything
aesthetically do I like where I'm at in
capacity that's four dollars a month or
every single actor would get a chance to
the slate scene 15 take one and they're
actor has certain characteristics that
the unlimited budget to fix everything
your two you're beginning mark is your
audition preparation process that's
century fox
important thing to understand
may or may not be possible depending on
supporting character scenes so here's
promises and fake promotions these
more complete way than what it's used to
you money but it's also going to save
professional actor you got to understand
do I go take a more traditional
mind-blowing when you buy a rental that
of needing all of the script to needing
so that means that you're just going to
all right guys this was a long video we
you're having a headache or whatever
$30 for 30-minute workouts pretty pretty
double door it's so frickin tall like
every single penny that you have
there are actors who make a living by
it really does not matter we are faced
is full price groceries my biggest hack
and I'm not trying to sleep anymore then
work and money and how it kind of fits
every single day of the week and if
so they decided okay we can't consider
you can learn HTML in a single day you
okay that's it for this video those were
now house hacking is guaranteed to lower
happens much
or thousands of dollars per year number
explain what that means
you want to do is you want to read each
with working 40 to 80 hours a week then
and i went home
2008 I walked into my very first acting
there if you do know for instance that
everyone who is trying to pursue an
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
for my own exams if you're watching this
to audition for those bigger projects
i have never once in my entire 13-year
want someone to always be on the lookout
people are scared to invest and get it
love that because it's something that's
you are still the biggest stakeholder in
enough so that you don't need to rely on
figure out what your budget is and how
it's just a lot easier to take that
videos these are two ways to
and every movie is a huge risk
know as actors because if you're in an
before anybody pays you to act before
casting directors posting things like
long ago 50 years ago so the bones are
important piece
you basically add all those payments up
i'm going to put a link to it down in
block out those days don't take any
be talking about today let's get started
actor's education i think
you can also ask other actors and your
maybe this step
you have to shop around it's crazy but
it depends on many factors for example
step number five is to create your
probably gonna be the kitchen the
such an online brand and a lot of the
majority of the money in the renovations
there is something that happens during
learning and i hope to see you on set
bumped up to a principal performer it
mind rock wear and couple really pity
main source of income then you can
might break unexpectedly there are tons
zero five percent of the loan amount if
exterior of the house right at sunset so
employer you can put in 25
consideration your location
the student film programs when they are
so that you understand exactly how
might want to say i'm going to create x
so what I'm trying to do is to make sure
actually drags me up the mountain just
i went full time
there is a potential that you could get
not gonna bring that much more equity
what you want is that
not work then this is actually I think
write that off or if you're going to buy
middle column so i'm going to hit it
not you can get
tell them that you're going to work hard
you got an audition and here are the
this now you may be wondering why I use
well lit earlier we talked about keeping
once you learn how to manage your career
quite passionate on house hacking and i
post that will never get out of here
especially now where
distribution this means you skip out on
this well let me show you a screenshot
audition for that project i know plenty
combat classes the Meisner technique the
on your net worth and again make sure to
all over the world and there's no way i
there's so much strategy already built
be taking acting classes you should be
on the other hand a 500 000 home in
working for them if you want to make the
you're going to be asked to perform a
before you submit it to the agent so now
go the second way of selling other
really good at that but i do feel like i
and broker education requirements
painting some cabinets doing some
word for word that I've been following
your car now you have guaranteed that
talk about first the things that we need
a handful of auditions a year
a credit score of 700 but your
interested in let's get started right
up there i call it my audition
you're interested in that video i'll put
my experience
you have control over that and if you
and back when i was doing photography
station set that we were shooting in and
of effort on their part and they just
and you study smart like how i said in
doing anything
the real estate industry so the first
paying that extra price for that trendy
think they might have said marvel in it
parts you might be too short for other
it's used by a company or by a business
warranties is if something
of those places so now i know a lot of
think about that more and then in our
do is just understand how
of acting
separate room
of information
this career that I think are hard and
other rooms or other units now if you're
one of these groups keep an eye out for
forward to seeing you on set one day
we have no idea what we should be making
lines from the script onto here and then
it just really doesn't make any sense
in during the day or two to best get the
and then you will film on set
will never become the best realtor out
my paint stuff that's not how it works
aren't going to need that whole time the
going to serve kind of as
the foods that you eat you know it
directors on social media follow them on
uh key ratios that you guys need to look
afford what you want to do is before the
auditions now not every audition will
simply because you feel like you don't
dollar industry like this one there are
programs are going to be making student
don't have a demo reel and the answer is
acting teacher can me and he is we he
agency this is why it is so important to
laminates or a wood countertop you still
serious about pursuing acting
career aspirations
like bend down and brush your teeth or
really effective when I do them together
because i had my full-time job already i
we tend to trust more because we've seen
financial reasons that it's
think about how much money you spend
cut that together and create a demo reel
is theater
because if your face gets seen as a
end of every course you take a final
this could potentially save you hundreds
those obstacles out of the way to make
not shoot in 4k I know some of you have
dollars that day
in acting
what that means and how all that works
yourself at home
doesn't seem like much when you're at
these the HGTV homes it's what you see
but most of the time for big budget
pretty crazy to think about so they
have some health complications
don't want to miss out on but come on
or taking a job that pays less but that
ownership i did this for a few years
sales and the total cost of the class is
are two different ways to take
furnish the place to fix things that
trying to I'm not used I don't use your
they want you to stand it's used in
that makes printers and scanners and all
are so yeah that kind of concludes this
differently but they can still have
pop up on the state exam what we want to
acting career all right that is it for
to help you learn the lines the third
product there's a guy called Kevin Kelly
loans since 2013 so hopefully that gives
the toilets and also the flooring these
getting started the best way to do this
casting websites like backstage
steps that it takes to cast a role in a
deliver that line ah
work with just your body you don't need
might get overwhelmed by what was going
roles that need to be cast for this
multiple different
role and I didn't end up getting it two
photo paper options as well
and they have to decide and pick 20 or
television show so that's another
enough is like the horizon always
background work out of your career
and so it goes back to sustainability
show experience on their resume to
need to hire a casting director this is
you haven't heard of him
typically used more for the crew actors
with family and friends
call back
we're now in the grand entryway it's
director or talent agent say that they
single time that you have an audition
shouldn' I Be Without You Turn On Your
helps to do your own research too
what the rules are and what the
but it's completely worth it and i
a part of the industry the way that this
until noon I no matter what I wake up
overboard with a full blonde costume the
category at the moment
then I would be if I were just reading
resume when you do
of these things have a one-time cost of
job is to help tell a story to the
shower pulling a shower really pretty
scene where your eyes look for that
the average first-time homebuyer only
a theater background who have done some
possible to become a working actor in my
theater and movies and tv shows but
movies and the bigger roles and all of
state currently
and give you some corrections if
auditioning and career advice every
for your commercial auditions not really
pay with money or your time in order to
do you want to become an actor of course
yourself I personally got my real estate
account for free
choosing to do a solo 401k
that i have impacted through my
information of how they what they can do
you can choose individual stocks
then just go with the cheaper one you'll
elect to join at any point in your
stable and it's not just the one time
just do kind of an
then you can sign up for an imdb pro
because they feel like oh i'm not my
but then they find out somebody else did
lawyer or a publicist
explosion all they're telling you is
really just comes down to your goals so
my commercial experience and that's the
earlier than you should not that you
every single workout and it's just not
are so many other aspects of this career
college students this is a really great
was actually working on an independent
and make sure it's photo paper this is
work does not
actually read the information and you
is such a massive source of stress in
just so you can see how this works
but now you can see what the billing is
pressure like you have to go full time
can either do them yourself or pay
involved and audition for
that's the answer to that question when
the rest of the show
so that's how i found out that shaq was
you don't want your first ever acting
sharpen my skills and to find new tools
on your own
don't you're going to really hate your
because those auditions are filmed so
director there's an acting teacher here
in the lender's viewpoint it has to be
you put this on the MLS the next morning
scene and not just the lines now you're
for a character like a tv news anchor
times so i didn't lie to you i did not
as i mentioned in almost all of my
you already have
but anyway when i first got the audition
in the united states you are either a
the same thing
many different
experience on
to address these things and give you a
but the less satisfaction we're able to
know if
generate passive income ie
reel and then show it to the casting
we don't want to just talk about you
sheet with the
get an audition that that says it takes
made for my business is masterminds and
available to us
on something it's gotta be a better
not only learning new content but when i
a corporate job where you're getting a
booked for the commercial now once i was
this is one option but it is certainly
to value that is your borrowing 80% of
how and where to find auditions well in
actual words that are written and just
do you know because I didn't want to mix
not a lot of film and television
training will also be an ongoing process
learning my 10 step audition preparation
that in my new course
specific than what I'm currently doing
life stability the lack of vacations
going to take this seriously
learning and acting class where you can
within your price range
there for your clients you won't have as
this is making a dying rather than
so while you can start a career from
many people like doing rentals because
Your Inner World Medical School And Ever
available for everyone because they're I
percentage Commission on the sale if
that experience
need to be able to fit right in and I
leave them down in the comments below
now they are easily
teacher and many other potential roles
budget for those as well some people
using random free tutorials on YouTube
week you could write one or two blog
huge huge benefits to having a talent
i would not be where i am today so you
countertop look a lot newer so yeah a
to be on set and to gain some experience
you've really internalized those lines
you can create your own credit to put on
on camera with the lights and everything
ago I was in London for work alright I'm
and it's a popular one and that is the
refer to your two marks as your one and
you want to jump over and watch that i
can use traditional financing you can
the perfect job for you you are able to
it out there so that people can see you
audition anyway even though you feel
are and motivations are and
six kind of go together five is to run
ever worked at a corporation
was one of the main characters maybe he
place for your long-term tenants
found this video helpful please spread
question is also about acting about more
audition time
yourself for acting opportunities all
for free
things my current demo reel is a
after the fact to decide to open up the
have marketing materials send me a DM if
discourage you not at all in fact quite
you're gonna offer is a good one
not your contact information you don't
people are going to work from home and
rather do it themselves and and because
new and put yourself out there a little
pain free performance specialist and we
story of some kind so if you're able to
i don't look like i'm 60 hopefully i
baton and i we were all locked in said
potentially for
master suite all right so we're gonna
salesperson and broker exams pass them
put into your acting career
software basically anything you can
to submitting those offers also keep in
huge depreciations and actually lose
and a self taped audition what should
be at a home inspection you can be
was released then i got my second
as you might be thinking you know we can
representation and let's say half those
someone asked you that dreaded tell me
got my real estate license to help buy
time and in the end they have to put it
to google and search for emory
but if you are someone like me who is
our first and last name in it so check
fortunately self-taping is not rocket
hundred thousand dollars it totally
so you know he's a huge huge celebrity
this industry my goal is to help you
complete beginner to make money online
between April 1st and May 1st the
job you'll like change the shoot dates
commuting costs food bought expensively
a cardio workout where you know I'm
because having those consistent bookings
on set
they have no idea how the business works
and saving some money by printing our
hypothetical audition like this I would
we do have to understand what objectives
the other nine that we've talked about
reps actors for stage work
investor starts out like that and it
you're taping make sure you go turn that
can see payment history is
outside of the industry with their
they're also gonna be closing costs and
that has a section on your resume as you
angle your face in your body so that the
all cash or you're buying under market
Health Service this is the video I wish
best five or eight roles and put those
from our coach and from the other
they're going to expect you to have some
those like nasty yellow walls that look
and seeing if they're trying to make a
the first thing is finances i feel like
and the rent that those tenants pays you
information i'm going to tell you what
every time you audition and every time
incredible to see just how much your
if you've already started taking acting
cheat sheet
they're all going to say that so how do
only 2 500 per month so if you do the
pretty good size and each room has a
need to do firstly we need to develop a
and then we go and audition live and in
i knew that now that they're shooting
not you're being treated fairly if
trend right now six inch lights are
real estate is such an amazing way to
little risky at first hiring someone new
with our memorization with lines you
and I bought so you know these are just
paid over a thousand dollars for
predict like what would have happened
McDonald's because those are competing
memorized so if someone asks you are you
practicing keep learning and i hope to
get your real estate license the courses

information in that course was really
auditioning and career advice every
was like oh my god I'm rich these days

before I sign off if you're interested
through this another five or ten times
basically means that you
putting into the principal the equity
and if you're sitting here thinking well
what does this mean for actors and
taken by a professional headshot
because when they did come in and the
and i only recommend doing it yourself
because and a lot of people don't know
are two
whenever somebody in the industry be it
but when they bought this house in 2016
i'd love to hear that okay
so those were all of the costs that i
a project freight down now I'll

videos are usually between 20 and 30
to join the union when you decide it's

payments and now obviously
20% if you're waiting on a home purchase
secondly is this expenditure of life

competitions by simply recording
grew up in a very athletic family where

you just need to to move around you just
everyday average human beings i've done
investment property so here you can see
costume for an audition and I first
the time works mayaken that I become
the film and television industry
question is asked and what you should
three percent of sixty thousand dollars
on your computer and four let your puppy
an audition simply because you feel like
gains i could talk about this for
learn before you get on to a higher
medical school applicants that teach
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
what is due and when it is due because
make you money people hire you for your
probably the easiest way of making money
that now for me if I want to sell an
have a photo printer but never even knew
shows don't use storyboards but they're
audition is a win even if you don't book
my website i have of resources on axwell
have had different experiences than i
quiet set earlier we talked about not
download that for free get it from that
make money doing it there's no business
want to do that
the role
i was ready to open up my own credit
theater is that a lot of people have
to shoot in 1080p and your file sizes
worked with over the past
to get the most bang for your buck on
try to answer that question here
flooring don't cheap out don't get the
fits into it you increase your chances
because rest and recovery are essential
that's a hundred five questions correct
that and the mastermind because it was
because i'm never going to get it
and that can draw lots of attention yeah
that in the film and television world a
really good coffee straight from your
important because i do know that there
and that's why you really need
saying someone with no basketball
for a brand that's pretty much being a
streaming services it's going to save
valuable then people will buy it and
on the zoom callback once again there
I'll see you guys in the next video
current city
considering when you are buying your
transitioning from the process
actors on first refusal
get to bed early to make sure I get
that's for mac and pc that can help you
thumbs up
on this section now one thing that you
me fifteen hundred dollars but that's
production but I'm sure you can find
costing you in mental space
many things that you can do
are sometimes thousands of people that
twice as much alright another thing is
for Friday at noon I give myself a
a monologue because
an acting career is training it's not
was a restaurant that we met at yeah
most actors don't start out living in
commercials as well
now that you have a professional
the molding and the trims choose maybe a
hey guys in this video we are going over
is going to help you once you transition
doesn't count as income
website called wirecutter and they do
going on behind the scenes from the
questions that you eventually see on the
so here's how the audition process went
quickly say to those people who are
business decision but remember this
lot of time going through the course and
working class is you harry potter we
the day
don't apply in right to work states in
for your blockbuster movies or your hit
find a broker or a mentor that can train
the acting career center here to help
can make money online and that is by
the next way that actors can make money
and experience under my belt I make over
outside of school many cities have
tech genius or anything like that to do
the acting career center here to help
pay down your mortgage
having it printed on both sides again if
to best use their time to get a workout
certain actors simply because those
Cut Pro like it's it's so easy you could
join them introduce yourself and keep an
your expenses are going to be different
money like they had a good amount of it
your imdb if you have imdb pro you can
after jobs and anywhere between 15 and
so in my opinion when you're just
especially if you can find the right
w-2 salary but the rest of the money
again if someone is inexperienced
impulsive purchases
month for PMI that's actually not too
time if you practice and keep learning
deals and especially if you're going to
for loans that's going to give you about
more interesting than the way that we
something very similar made by Canon or
that so when i joined the union here in
who are brand new if this is your first
union laws the union laws that apply to
generate revenue for example let's say
i ultimately decided to go ahead and
third time's the charm so hopefully at
your housing bill
me to rehearse and I can do this when
have a little income and have it be
this is going to be
on the back or you'll print it on a
the first takeaway is that and i
they want they can pay whatever wages
brought back for a callback they usually
anytime a production makes more money
you're just starting out you definitely
other character I'll pause it to say my
investing heavily in this year anyways
thing that i would have in place before
here in atlanta now i've made another
to book you for a role in the movie it
what you've done but when you go to an
anything that could
one is gonna be more healthy and more
your actual course you take that final
steal it one day and just nice and read
then if that is the case you know you
a lot of brand new actors will look at
directors the information that they
in a short amount of time and that's
every single day
you're traveling when you travel you
or out of town they have to pay their
that rent will eventually buy later on
every actor can expect to spend some
my list is buying internet that is just
dollars and you go there seven days a
fits you
because you never have to worry about
actually have to pay for it you have to
and demo reels
hard to get clients for this first six
goes up now in many parts of the country
very kindly sponsoring this video if you
and when i say small market i don't
helped me book many movies and
and throughout these stages we
they'll be working with
getting taken advantage of
you can you can you can walk out of the
directors and the producers thought that
your circle is going to hear from their
into in my business that truly has
money for that skill or service now
unprepared for that question and had no
or maybe a safety video on how to be
know three to five percent is pretty
never played basketball before in my
it's really going to help you to see
on self improvement this is going to
insurance per year right now in order to
seven or eight days and we got six
just doing a 30-minute workout it
fastest and cheapest way
and with a triplex you have two rentable
exactly what i wanted my brand to be
that point you can actually cover up the
hundred dollars then you're just not
in fact i just switched insurance
solid foundation for your business is
for example the cabinets the fridge the
five percent
a lot of business owners
want to talk about today and how we help
the major cities in the united states
marketing the house is really important
without having an
is to write it off in your s corp tax
other roles that day they could be lets
actors are storytellers whether you're
put 20% down it's so common here in the
seven hundred dollars per year which in
into the film and television industry
another really important thing that we
And I Can Hold You King Cold Steel With
download that for free you can go by
anything else and yes audition for plays
loan so let's say you are getting a
your work
implement the five day rule
a conversation with him
it's a house that you are gonna be happy
to see you can also browse publicly
had just for you and I think we both so
casting decisions aren't made on the
that I like to do is that I will give
about halfway through right now
my audition and i sent it in and then i
the series regulars on this pilot for a
you know
that could throw them off right then and
audition I've heard many auditions where
paying rent for a space that's too
they'll decide well you know what this
outsource and i think that's so
incredibly helpful as well so
what you're saying and you get an idea
if i want to this happens in
those few people that can't afford to
to really help you pass the test on your
I hope you guys learned something from
remodel can range anywhere from a few
per month and yeah that's a very easy
point which is
1,000% prepared for your auditions
your risk for an audit but just
because i was able to get my agent in
and if it's a high profile project they
that a lot of the questions on the
see the exponential growth that comes
three levels of making money online if
roughly eye level an easy way to do this
name was daniel barnes
is really going to add up just note that
ourselves the next day you know one of
hire a big celebrity
bring us to set and as soon as we got
now not every city uses casting networks
one of the most important things that
that's why
well the big problem with that two big
aggressive with your tax write-offs if
what made them into the great actors
of when you have someone with experience
teacher named mr hartsburg on episode
actor because
world is worn with medical school with
in the gym so that we're stronger in our
financial stability and
make sure to go to acting career center
it's an opportunity to build a
sale like there's a really good review
project like that you know working like
time to update that character
your rental income is higher than your
corporation which will help you on every
and you will thank me later
different role
learning how i approach
sale and so if you get enough visitors
I'm talking about
jumpstart their career alright until
payments the higher the LTV the higher
continuing with the star wars example
this is basically just
a feeling like that and I don't think
states is 54 years old we do have an
foot four runway model type companies
connections you have in the industry
everything it takes to succeed agents
the steps you need to take
did I took my real-estate course online
personal trainer yeah yeah you know I
find those as well
so if you are already following casting
my opinion is the most important thing
audition all right if you like this
for let me first tell you what I've been
that has helped me book
home inspection is so
final step step number six beware of
all have hd cameras in our phones these
videos now a training video for a
experience that you would get
you get diversification
flip that around and really prioritize
take notes and at the end of each
of what house hacking is house hacking
getting your utilities cut off but it
that have provided safe working
a new brand of paint brushes and in this
and 15 minutes to do it but most people
auditions i didn't end up booking them
that's that's the answer it depends you
properties and in some cases you should
role was for a police officer I
just how amazing this type of house
is to keep your demo reel on the shorter
drop whatever they're doing and focus
moving parts to different things in my
about fifteen percent
was you know a lot easier to get through
take hold of some questions will i break
podcast now
now that model is no longer in
and secondly affiliate marketing let's
I'm also utilizing what I have and not
if you want to be taken seriously by
or a production so a performer an actor
do as much as you can where you are and
these then you're gonna be spending a
in our own lives right the more that we
blone programs out there that let you
fact you could do everything right you
see audition please
come earlier master how to work with
an on-camera class so don't go looking
but the reality is that it's going to be
single 137 that's that was just 2 years
fifty dollars now in addition to this
reasons number one
tune in to find out in addition to
investing in self-taping equipment is
getting a loan for
from the production markets on average
major leak in the house that's why a
career route and
you record a demo reel as a self tape or
your agent or casting director or
and that happens in the acting world all
tons and tons of these questions that
just understand that costar is a smaller
actor as always if you have any
an actor in american movies and tv shows
prioritize their financial situation
example of how I answer that dreaded
for their career so it is important that
and uh when i was just getting started i
tell you guys
these are gonna be the things that you
one of the best ways that i have seen
today that if you have ever thought any
commercial audition
and i'll define what that is right now
heard the stats most real estate agents
but they were nice enough to say the
back to the original question
or just a blank piece of paper or
Oh point four five percent to one point
what that means
but i never got to meet him he was on
be where i am in my career right now had
something that I've worked on to try to
i have learned that production has
then i've created a free audition cheat
do i work on a scene when
in high school
each area and property is going to be
in a play a movie a TV show or you're
so I'm I'm more like Steven Seagal's
four ways to get auditions without an
but these 10 things for self taping I
how what they do on a day-to-day basis
you're going to say how can i have
have an agent or not
and yet i've been able to work on a
on our side for example people who
have you been doing everything that you
audition so they might tell you at an
90 of the work is still on your
searching for the actors making it
and if you love building relationships
is there anything else i can improve
and i was already living in america i
other things in the acting career now
they will range between probably a
you should probably have a home office
you might have some web series and
so here are my tips on finding good
is to make sure your camera is roughly
already you definitely want to subscribe
you're gonna have a lot of experience
cheat sheet it's my own personal
and one thousand
lot less space than we did before
there wasn't the pressure
didn't book any of them
that's going to be super exciting change
i had a virtual assistant that would
I'll give them stuff to do so that
years old and they're an adult
opportunity again
opportunity to work on an episode of The
why i want you to get advice from as
the idea of becoming rich and famous
show more of a contrast between those
finance investing in the
an acting career
topic which
tuned hey guys it's Kurt from
spread but they look more bulky four
look like
sell your first house quicker than that
which ones they would like to see
ever should but a lot of actors
four different ways to get auditions
conflicts product conflicts are used in
are years in
to visualize you in the role of the
see you on set
to mention and this is an important one
other room that you can hear from where
spending some time here with me today
unless it's an emergency right so you
questions for me darling be home soon
so they said block out those days so
a professional headshot you know what
and what we morally believe and thirdly
the acting career center here to help
cannot audition for a commercial for
they'll charge between five to ten
one you're getting paid more than being
it's been really great for a lot of my
the audition and this is the part that
for you and send you deals when they pop
to create and
do as much as you can in your current
cutting off half our heads you
summaries in
you do have those popcorn ceilings that
number two is to have a non distracting
and save on the right things as well we
people that have a traditional nine to
or a tv
anymore to say all the lines now you
course completely online so an in-person
if you're interested in learning about
actor by doing these things you can also
went up so much
Association of Realtors and from there
that they want to buy these days buyers
those were my top 20 terms that you will
hacking can be
uh respond and then they ended up
so test out all the streaming services
the most important thing to convey to
brand was truly such a great investment
hey guys in this video we are going over
and uh even though i'm totally cool with
case i put the university of arizona
agent that you are taking your career
obviously there are a ton of actors who
so just be aware of that and be ready
to start getting involved and getting a
stay safe they high decay we will
not be able to do those things
i started my acting career in cleveland
what's the best agent in phoenix or who
actors to post their headshots and
had let my own doubts and insecurities
pros and cons
keep doing that but until you have that
plenty of actors that have done that and
available now for example
the voice recorder app on my phone and
for most people i'm talking like at
from a from a lesson standpoint there
reminds me of one of my favorite
you're paying that fifteen point three
could just be paying a few thousand
actually use
and renting the unit out there are
be on sale or at least some variant of
in the industry agents casting directors
and you are dressed in full police
if you liked the video make sure to hit
put those plays on your resume as well
five job anything that has a w-2
now a reader can be just the casting
you know anything to get your name out
from your own
Sharon wrote a book called how to
had i started younger had i started like
like really listening and being aware of
what your intent is and just know that i
thought we were gonna talk for like 20
rental rates have not
need tax records you'll need w-2s
don't close any deals but also you can
real estate agents could have a youtube
familiar with it
which way to turn
and if you want to download that free
do we check that well one way to do it
you're gonna see me talk about my dog
because i have seen casting calls where
the resume and the demo reel and the
that so
not always but it is a system that if
right number seven is
charge you one month's rent and then
journey of becoming a professional actor
in this industry casting directors
auditions whether that's a casting
to going online and doing virtual
to stop acting I know of the book I've
therefore they're standing closer to the
in today's video we're talking about 10
and as we move from the bare necessities
this to be mean they're not doing this
in to the film and television industry
experience so that we can
there's something wrong on a set or you
all of my acting classes that i've taken
things that i wasn't even incorporating
yeah yeah well that's great that's great
gonna want something more like a 2700 K
that's gonna save you thousands and
production company when they hire
seven so those three oh one more thing
or i put a link down in the description
a half by 11 headshot because that is
role in a movie so i was
that that class setting that want the
those at all
single job
things that i am really gifted at that
we are directly involved in right
and that will cost anywhere between
of the actor before they come out on set
do you have any conflicts during this
eminent domain and really memorize the
and what rents you should expect it also
it needs to have your stats and some way
keeping people poor
in that role and i think that's really
well if you live all the way across the
but it really adds up so while it is
should do background work or how much
that you should know is that you can do
that we as actors have zero control over
are 300 actors auditioning for it well
but what i have found to be like out of
after an nba game and they said this was
specific type like people over seven
actually cares about and they tend to
way beyond you calling a bunch of random
mean anything that's the name of the
they were kind of joking and laughing
movie or a TV show or a Netflix show or
so in my mind i'm thinking darn i did
so when I wrote out that sentence it
i would get together with my friends
with you and at this point you need to
score i've made other videos about this
yourself at an audition and while you're
the person auditioning you don't want
know every single thing there is about
actors commercial actors as well as some
certain number of jobs
you're asking someone to buy stuff and
as much as they want to so now let's
start taking classes that are offered in
what these types of videos are similar
apply and
having a professional headshot not only
that's because
ones that make the best investment back
headshot well
gonna be able to sell later on and
scumbags are preying on the hopes and
student films and independent films and
below it's a list of cameras and lights
make sure that you're ready to give up
three forms of value that people will
you're automating and streamlining as
right when a casting director or an
with you and the question form and at
lows during an activation email and the
in the right ways so let's get started
spend like we're rich even if we do have
the audition room
so grateful for you guys
this stage in my business getting that
do brush my teeth get changed in
but if you don't then do plan it out
for a house unless of course you are
on that show and if you didn't get a
now they're talking to the camera to the
of the clothes i buy are on sale it's
why a demo reel is so important for
about how I self tape my auditions I've
is how this works for me is that when
the library and just finding these books
and so that's why i think studying
ways you can learn how to code online
less than that so if you are in the
have callbacks sometimes they will
your eyes should be looking during your
to become a better actor
that in your life
people don't write off if you can
agent so you want to be that first name
a storyboard a storyboard is simply an
um typically on a monthly basis how much
want so if you're working full-time or
this video
to use the house exclusively for
repped by an agent in that city
you make on the side that actually
voice over and various other categories
now so you can do all of that from your
going to be able to offer you for most
book television shows like The Vampire
absolutely huge for me so that's the
help you edit videos or do research this
definitely you know
good credit of course because you're
stunt experience in their background
some other channels now before we get
licensed professional that can help
do it yourself but make sure the
the right region when you are submitting
what's a little bit more common these
that basketball analogy
idea of how the conversation flows and
other people to cast us in a project
should be the max amount of money you
right because it's one of the biggest
faster paced than others and I'm not
the ground and and have my existential
fixer-uppers and doing some of these
because of some reason that is
was no mention of shaq
buy a rental it affects your cash flow
by going to that link right up there
i've worked on and so if you want to see
experts aren't fond of investing in
i hope it was helpful as always if you
union wages they have to follow all of
but uh because everybody was experienced
about that
importance of acting class but this is
then you get those residual payments but
now before you install those lights if
to this channel to get more videos on
throughout your career you'll eventually
takes me right to the website where i
from two to four dollars I think is a
country do as much as you can in terms
the kitchen and the living room if
the industry who makes decisions who can
uh facebook groups and things like that
person's license you need to find a
on set but then
can see what your acting ability is okay
for television shows or movies that
more videos on acting
it can provide extremely valuable
advertisements so this is another way
like actors access like casting networks
how does this work let's talk about that
going to take you seriously
this template
that most people have they want to
you liked this video please give it a
with you either work with them in person
line for the patient a question and then
be that that big like there's a load of
they are good agents most of them
been running for nine and a half years
she was deciding to go full time
own business
little to get all the educational
the very first thing you should do
the wrong impression sorry I didn't get
you can get those auditions now that is
lore principal kate shortland and then
I saw that book at my photo studio
or at least move
mention is that some of the some of
hundreds of dollars on a photo printer
getting an agent is down the line but
80% LTV or lower once you get to that
rates aka your mortgage and control
and a hundred and sixty-six
when you start working with an agent
interviewing or talking to we've seen
talks about that really illustrates this
all have to find the the path and the
real estate investing whether that's
the main thing that i would
the value of the home now let's say for
pretty much just as good quality like
there's a very real possibility that 14
number six but actually this step is
here in north america the most commonly
your ability to demonstrate the product
is easier for example
that well
buckingham alright i am here with tyler
29th or something like that
auditions before we get to the 10
more opportunities to get
fact I use them pretty regularly in my
networking you should be learning about
card holder is about seven
audition sides we have the role that we
forget what is one direction you want to
you know please do not audition for the
we only did that first sentence but like
48 dollars per year
wars you would write lead on your resume
two or more years the irs is not going
fulfillment is our compass and our
director to keep you in mind for future
like best I personally prefer matte
people saying hey i want to be part of
classes available
we want them to show us that they are
it took me a second to kind of gather
thanks to minimalism honestly we need a
side closer to three months if you
in this video i'm going over seven
each and every day and on how many
con the content topic obviously the
auditioning and career advice every
to create your demo reel for you
with your best content and don't fall
money as an
purchase price of the home because
i don't think that is the smartest way
you need to run the numbers we want to
like i said i've done a bunch of these
i've had to step away from doing youtube
situations is you're gonna start at one
much from from the earth if you will
I was at a callback for a movie and the
the producers now
articles from podcasts from your own
look taking the attention off of
week later i found out that i got a
also fitting those workouts into our
that are required in order to get your
in more detail but when you have a
because they're going to tell you how
ninety percent of the work is still on
store brand product
can't get into a house if you can't buy
funny story to tell
competitive this industry is
you're looking at and if it is a
seemed to be the biggest ones and you
by bonnie gillespie
roi i definitely recommend assessing the
you can find these opportunities because
to read every single word
casting director
know the bucking and fitness community
competition which could make itself more
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
your rates can generally be about 0.125
you're to have to make in terms of your
the list is keeping too much stuff and
acting career now i want to take it a
consider donating them consider selling
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
helped me book over 50 movies and
your upfront mortgage insurance premium
trying to do because like you said
probably get
option is la the best place to go well
they would probably keep me in mind for
it would be good to start at the
their new paint brushes so in this type
so do you need a talent agent to pursue
ahead of themselves
guys you
right way
agent costs and the misconception that
actors from acting teachers from
is corporate industrial videos or
watching if you did like this video and
you should join the union
here's an example
project the writer the director the
down below self taping commandment
going to that link right up there
gigabyte of video right my audition
interested in you might want to look
the objective here is to meet working
second thing that i've invested a lot
hundred thousand dollars of profit
pay full price for clothing i just don't
guarantee you that that is completely
so well that she can take what i do on
sharing all this free content with you
content versus paid content needs to be
performer records it on their own and
and that is to rehearse with another
wasn't there and you know I there's no
channel to get more videos on acting
try and stop doing these things there's
our region and definitely no tv shows
can really skill your lead generation
person without being affiliated with a
consider you for other roles in the
first thing you want to do is read a
actual movie we're trying to film our
now look these plays are not going to
if you did the show in school you would
full-time in your business
money saved up in the bank it also means
life as a landlord easy because if you
really go through the information
if you like this video please give it a
middle of the scene while we are doing
but just now there are sub when you are
in urban justice
and that time i also did not get to meet
card and start using credit cards
bunch of people who can make the live
an audition
I book this role then oh I've got I'm
you do have to join the union after a
of something new just sort of faded with
specifically i'm going to
bright color sometimes can also be
classes each week for thirty minutes so
if you're going through these questions
offer accepted or it could be as quick
me back off for a second
time or better yet what am I gonna do to
talk about uh
still work you can still hang out
so that's a hundred times more
they will actually reimburse you for
me I'll be very reliable and I'll always
actor and i understand that in the
tight that you can really just stand in
classf get perfect headshot is not just be
takes me away from this and all of my
actors contacting them asking for
helping you find auditions you as an
anything further then to your hobby if
if you like the video make sure to hit
don't know
PMI payment instantly so no you won't
video as you can probably tell i'm
and hopefully try to win the competition
point you're going to want to create an
all these other actors who did provide
do you start working as a real estate
checks as well so it can be a great
your nutritional health it's just really
if not everyone gets it
they gave i think four or five
commission off of anything that you make
course they're gonna be comfortable and
now speaking of auditioning once you
3000 K because I found that was the best
content creator or if you own a product
constantly doing different things as a
there are so many things that you can
saying there are tons of ways to invest
a very turnkey house number four is to
feel like you're burning out i can think
your acting career and i think that's an
actors access you can actually get an
have to pay all of those extra costs so
outside of the united states but you
third avoid talking about acting they
if you don't book one particular job if
so that is step four step four is the
i just never had a got a chance to have
was vegan for some time it became a
have film and television credits
cabinets are still in relatively good
it's a free video transcoder called
standpoint exactly why they're giving
all right let's talk about these four
wouldn't have it any other way and so if
switching the necessary steps away and
controlling ourselves so here there's
you can sell to them three years down
have a big audition like the five page
marvel projects are notorious for this
estate practice and your real estate
reasonable salary and the rest of it
upfront mortgage insurance premium
skim through the online education read
the reason a production would want to go
would not have gotten
or non-union so what's the difference
step one
referring to movies when they say take 1
really great loan that lets you put down
of how i booked my first hollywood movie
atlanta which doesn't quite
it just like overlooks the entire
look for the produce that is on sale
the rest of your life you give me reason
with another person that's that's a lot
14 and i went on 20 auditions and i
he is a big supporting character you
so that's the same thing that you should
super valuable this is going to help you
instead save yourself a lot of money and
commercial or in a project or someone's
find auditions and learn everything else
do rely on someone else for the majority
to the wall just so they could see all
mistakes that have nothing to do with
we're studying acting because we want to
many of my friends and i know plenty of
that stuff awesome let it work with your
set one day
happened they put us in a production ban
strongest and so it's careful which
audition but we can still consider him
so much and I ended up turning down the
why i
crowd to help you
can't bring to the table
have no problem with monologues being
how many things have i bought that were
I'll do it for ten I'll do it for twenty
available for
the middle of the pandemic
amount of money that they are able to
hopefully that makes sense and this
cost a little bit more
acting ability it's because they don't
test as long as you study effectively
to a major network so let's assume you
movement patterns of the six that I just
my computer and I see a file named
that make us look like amateurs today I
over a hundred thousand dollars
waste so much money buying tons and tons
is what it takes to become a
pieces come together so people know who
once you do get representation now
starting an acting career
then in three years time you build up a
any questions alright until next time
it's the very last thing that I do
set the chart down and then
will make real estate investing a much
we want to sell is something that has a
on that so fifteen thousand dollars
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
take a class if you're just getting
that their head shots may not turn out
have to make sure
to have another person like I said with
what steps do you need to take well
not just talking about college because
in any situation self taping commandment
many years ago when I was still
you definitely want to subscribe to this
we're going to consider him still for
um probably make that jump to go full
get is like do I take an online class or
all homebuyers in general they only put
acting auditioning and career advice
headshot jpg I don't know whose headshot
step one develop a skill that others are
questions in the comments a lot of the
getting a great workout I feel it in
in a television show so i'm gonna put
person that helps
producers future cinematographers
lasting fulfillment and beyond that peak
definitely a long time so that's why
waiting to buy a house just so that you
or binging like no guilty but hey if I
you know I've got some time in my honey
entire roster of actors and potentially
important to talk to a lender they're
billing section and then we're gonna
things but from an investment standpoint
to subscribe to this channel to get more
your research before signing with an
people in acting class you write your
they simply mean to turn your body and
independent films and short films
of storage yeah the walls are kind of
in order to work with an agent
still getting my Netflix it yeah that's
to audition
spaces into additional rooms so maybe
the optimal score you should be looking
size recessed lights you want so you can
reason for that is because
emotions that they want to convey in
to share you know tips and tricks for
you get rid of that emotional spending i
automating as much as you can before you
videos for a little bit
there's a lot of like nutrition camps
real estate about entrepreneurship
who are the creators of stranger things
in all in every market in the country so
i limit it to less than 10 on each
this is probably the most competitive
what i mean by this is
your budget how much house can you
some people will say that this should be
three thousand dollars now if you decide
again independent films short films
where you read through the information
three things can help you
down to take that extra time to just
over a thousand of these questions and
headshot photographer not any
as an example when i first got started
would never have been able to find on
that sixty thousand dollars is going to
lunch and it's like okay so what are you
year in 2021 i auditioned for a pilot
oscar-winning actors the link is in the
one it's a lot of fun two we're always
the last thing you want to do is to miss
what's that ninety percent well that is
your resume this can be printed on the
and it certainly is the case for
story because there are union
you time because
i'm huge on saving money and when you
now this window is an 8 by 10 aspect
it lets you put in a ton of different
more often than on a movie or a
advertise my services I had my home
casting director then is less likely to
so it's getting an agent like walking
and fifty dollars and that can get
consistent focus in order to get there
important thing for any real estate
casting session
the world pretty much as long as you
footage meaning a demo reel to show us
guarantee you your future self is going
so the second phase of studying is
or teaching someone to do something but
products and level three attention I've
the name of the teacher sanford meisner
i've done tons of this when i was just
hired i know people who have worked on
of the mortgage these loans are issued
on your tax return now this is where
like don't be too bold
long term
the websites Fiverr or upwork and browse
you know you get some gorgeous blues in
Express the course that I used in the
megabytes which are very manageable to
doing this topic and i didn't know if i
because they've signed a contract to say
one week before your actual exam start
app or an online course or an e-book all
auditioning now if you're interested in
that you don't have to accept everything
here are all the people that fit that
if you get down between 720 and 740 then
instances where that has happened before
uber rental car
want to do one workout a week two three
doesn't necessarily mean that that movie
agent then
the fast food
together a playlist for you right here
with a low down payment of five percent
it's due to compound interest
we really loved your previous auditions
if you drive a lot of miles but you have
a year but when you are first starting
the first agent that they think about
they reveal it
want that steady stream of clients year
if you just happen to know me you may
those are photos you take of the
prepare and then I would do that
allows you to take
network because your teachers and your
up I'll give you some free study
hundreds of thousands of dollars
with long-term investing and even for
best performance in the history of the
and asking what did I do wrong well
in to the film and television industry
thumbs up if you have any questions
it for today thank you so much and i'll
and your resume will be a pdf document
self-taping setup for home
call our job
part of the business side of acting this
more possessions don't actually give us
more money does not lead to more
to make sure the viewer can see all of
your character would be wearing but you
said that three of my four scenes got
shinier look now this is really your
word you can work on a little bit but
lot of us really struggle with this
taking classes
however long you're working with them
quite a bit
is extended warranties stanford
commercial world and in the film and
full script for a television show or a
income tax so the cool thing about an s
wasn't auditioning for film and tv so it
the patience or the thick skin to deal
started first one
questions you need to get seventy
those instances if you want to get an
from it as well just because I've seen
full year in atlanta
chances of being in that small
I'm gonna be showing you how you can get
something and we're just gonna go
biggest reasons why many actors don't
people however when you learn about how
that shaq was gonna be in the commercial
you are and get a sense of you know what
W I L you period
actually selling the watch and we
sounds awesome i just want to act in a
keep that item because they assign a 100
investing works
percent of the time when I get an
auditions and then later on they offered
of a week sounds right very doable hey
scene over again sometimes they will
everything onto one page of a resume it
informative if you did make sure to
start with something available in school
moment I knew it could at classf for
record a self tape as a demo reel do it
your experience level and we're gonna
better chance of being cast if you don't
but they were all wins because they
ado here is my interview with tyler
Peter McKinnon has done very well
enjoying this interview do me a solid
I started to focus on my scene Paul and
ocking stuff so I'm sure we'll do this
on the movie venom i didn't audition for
stress can also have adverse effects
that's that has that sweet stuff yeah I
in a union state you must join the union
that you see around us a lot of people
main focus of a production like this and
every week
just very important to get good at this
screaming and yelling and anger that
storyboards especially during our
hiring an experienced agent so yeah just
like you may not fit the description of
in proportion to the life energy spent
and she just could not keep up with
actor while they're trying to get all
and push through them so the agent can
because we want to see some of your
days so you definitely don't have to go
this whole world of stuff that you can
amount of money so that is how affiliate
how can i get a sports agent
calling just know that there are so many
I should be 2 pounds less and it's like
sell homes for yourself as a real estate
getting pre-approved for a residential
into your account
you're showing up but
talk to the professor and do all the
an industry that's built on
don't set the bar super high I mean my
but then we can sell infinite copies of
action and that somewhere between the
any other job so what's the difference
an hour that would be 80 hours of life
to explain is what i mean by
on Skillshare I automatically have this
this so I don't get super sweaty or
actors with it so yeah the main the main
submissions of the actors that don't
because that episode continues to get
less a bigger market might cost a little
get information
answer and see why that answer is
having to spend much more time so the
non-union actor and a union actor is
brand new to this channel if this is
who is not the lead character but is a
from these possessions and so with this
i never have to join the union
the box is there an opportunity
dozens of movies and television shows so
agent so you would put your own phone
throughout their
a lot depending on how much a commercial
not gonna make you watch me write write
you book just one in 10 auditions in
professional resume
or for your state so once you join these
nine little panels and i just thought it
really depends on the lender that you go
everyone knows at least one realistic
actually train and mentor you to be
sheet that you can download by going to
people and so especially i mean even if
this little crop window what we do now
enjoy the journey
the next bad money habit to break is
is emory medical school so if i just go
why you're doing this thing or why
there is so much stuff to be done in
you're trying to pursue film and
regular but if you're not going home and
biggest things with house hacking is
like do you remember where we met it was
many actors make a living there are a
this self taping commandment number five
i've never lived in hollywood
for a loan however 740 plus is optimal
used casting websites are actors access
services and products and those are sort
you might be prospecting all day trying
stop thinking about yourself
forums where you can learn a ton of
gonna learn how to do all the stuff
plus half the other actors coming in to
character breakdown i then look at my
god of war and with mirrors world ends
guys it's not a big hassle
start at the beginning of the month but
reason that they signed me
welcome thanks for watching if you
here I don't know if you can read it but
you can
that is considered an exceptional credit
on-set experience and demo reel footage
little bit cool it's again what you are
to prepare for your state exam so the
cheat sheet and it's my actual
it easier when people so that's why I
i'll go into that in a second here let's
could spread the word and tell people
those don't
you would write that name of the teacher
okay i'll do it your way
very enticing but it takes time and
hacking is it allows you to get
learn about right
to overcompensate for potentially bad
backtrack again to that story i just
good-looking for other parts yeah that
important to the beginning of every
that you are
going to make you stand out like a sore
value can i give out to the internet
you can and if you really want to do
questions feel free to leave them down
that you can sell your expertise on and
three days later
real estate salespersons course now this
first instinct was to do the audition
already did a commercial for Burger King
into the weeds of all that but i will
and being a personal assistant and admin
nothing scripted so i recorded my
credits that most people will start off
other jobs for those days because you
if you haven't heard anyone say it
and having fun and getting your feet wet
the 30 for 30 I'm gonna put a link to
you need to think why you want to get a
forward slash ali and the first 200
classes altogether and go straight to a
foot off the gas
10 ways to gain experience as an

roll camera roll sound and meanwhile
I'm gonna be doing the breads and the
how I became successful I started

all right enough about cobra kai let's
next time you get an audition first of
good because you know we make money
print that's it pretty easy right if you
but i do want to give you guys some
to 300 bucks so it's cheap replacement
do the next day and these are the
practice question that there is this is
audition let me give you a couple of
my free audition
being an entrepreneur is so awesome and
just don't have the time so that's why
suck and i don't really believe that
and that transformed the way my images
gonna work for me right so let me tell
he was an a-list celebrity
okay but now let me talk about a couple
college there are many other types of
know there's no way to go back in time
so how can you make sure
going to move on to the next person who
anyways i hope you guys found these tips
television show or even a commercial our
those are all extra expenses for the
may not be a professional yet you could
10 steps that i use to help prepare the
and you want help and pursuing your
set Monday I gotta go put this back my
that does not go on your acting resume
more videos on acting
in my experience typically you have
closer to the source you can be the
I'm also a recent first-time homebuyer
these are the essential things that you
but they really do add up when you're
financial literacy
example you have agents like ryan
and you'll be paying this 15.3 percent
you how i auditioned for
travel costs they have to pay for a
they should do
is cost we talked about earlier that it
especially when you consider the fact
one was a male and one was a female now
another way that actors can make money
much at all in getting through a real
and the lower your credit score the
you will get more auditions from them
kitchen is probably the most important
house in my opinion is the backyard and
in capital gains so right off the bat
as well as a ballpark figure for how
channel or just people asking me in
the more years you spend in the market
and then three weeks went by i didn't
look at the television film and web
is a right-to-work state it's also
your lines at least that is my belief
maybe we were just wrong for the part
changed though my team has definitely
conventional loan another benefit of
conversation and the emotional reality
problems with that one
small-market actor calm now way back in
first house so I work in real estate and
earlier if you are looking for a place
a multi-million dollar project when the
not then
an agency charges you a large upfront
extremely excited for you guys like i
doesn't mean that you should move
money so based on my research the median
first starting out
for my auditions I don't use all seven
and this is another situation where the
which is about 3% per year if you're
if we're doing everything right for
out from all the reading in your real
and hundreds of auditions there have
training now a quick google search for
if you like this video please give it a
they only give them to talent agents
film and television actors union is sag
talk about the difference between
starting out in their career they're so
the principal actor would be on the set
whether we're buying this thing because
will you know go to every show they'll
down in the description below but i
so they put multiple actors on first
can contact them
directly that's why it is so important
doesn't sign you and the reason is
flow of business which is typically
you that it was going to be easy
makes you look
because you'll learn as you do it and
you'll need to identify the ones that
2700 monthly payment you can see that
then i got put on first refusal then i
running or jogging on the elliptical I'm
cheat sheet you can do it by clicking
this is even better
over and over again when you look at
investor or a real estate professional
making real estate your entire life you
but no matter where you move understand
background performer then your
can pretty much learn anything online
that way
cost three thousand dollars
the real estate exam
than the person auditioning and there's
first of all let me welcome those of you
a net surplus of about 300 so this is
these tips are gonna apply and they're
reels that's an easy way to create your
of actors will say well if i need a demo
in class so that when you get on set
created a web series called
sure i had already exists so that let us
name of the play
building that relationship and think
into the film and television industry
casting networks
hi and the skin in the unicorn truck
yourself and putting all of your focus
that you will probably have to think
booked this second commercial without
you're gonna use it again in the next
this is probably going to be a parent or
these costs
movies and television shows
again so I found doing this to be really
practicing keep learning and I hope to
we tried to figure out our schedules and
actor be it on the technique side or
good in here and then from the kitchen
whenever people say that i live in a
millions or billions of people
project all right that's it for today's
having 20% down it's not a punishment
free basically if you're subscribed to
locked in a pitch-black closet don't
two characters so they ended up casting
get to set your own hours you don't need
acting career who had already been on
sorry for the change in scenery i
is simply a waste of money for most
know billing for me on this side I'm
relationships are and really understand
with making a commitment to learning a
way back when all of these online
depreciation schedules next up is that
well in this video I show you why that
actually let me say that let me
kind of an exciting week of things
as well even if your ultimate goal
drenched in sweat completely soaked
on earth the precious hours of life
there's so much to learn and this is a
differences for sure but in general
that put way too much emphasis on
city that you currently live in
think about acting just like any other
parents did that for me and by the time
say blocks
of you the camera sees through its lens
you know who follow my channel
an audition and you don't have the
you learn the skills you need to break
drove to pittsburgh i did my audition
purchase one of your website templates
again this is an exchange of value we
study is to questions are so in turn and
space feel a lot more open a lot bigger
my life
extra on a television show you do not
so go check out cobra kai if you get a
interested in theater
income level so let's say you're in the
and when you do a monologue you don't
or thousands of dollars per year if you
those will not
instructions as best as you can if you
estate course and pass the final exam
first line my first line here is a few
opportunities to audition for plays and
character the third column in the
a.m. Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on total
since then but I actually found that one
because i'm going to be chatting with
that flash back to home that of the
selling goods services and attention
attractiveness does come into play as
it's not about the pursuit of happiness
whenever you want
people on your team helping you
uh they end up changing things around
even if they are your friends once
trusts to lend you money and how much
or a DVD or whatever that has a bunch of
theater as well now most theater
unfortunate truth is that too many
chase your dreams
on your scene partner so that you can
made all right that's it for today
they now look at all of these actors and
energy in alignment with my values and
learn a lot of things that are going to
weight training or fitness exercises a
able to you know just elevate my brand
that's the cost of borrowing the money
supposed to move from a biomechanical
role without ever auditioning for it
already know you're an actor they have
make money when you make money meaning
this is split between three separate
plus you can do video games you can
you go into an audition dressed in full
background work for that show
that's good for both you as well as the
buy things that are on sale i bet you
time there were no
across from me and the bride
widely used
also need to consider that it's probably
James Bond I must be too good-looking
running times to him I mean he's my
15 years ahead in your career right now
rent out the extra bedroom or the extra
workshops and classes to teach actors
when a customer orders that watch we
projects to create things to put onto
director of the commercial
eventually get offered a completely
you to do it because
so the way that you would put training
booked my role
listing out there today needs a 3d tour
today very well with white
going to involve some type of blend
classes that you can be taking to
well if it's gonna go up or not and how
you have something called your thirty
take this seriously
finding some type of exam preparation
myself to even remember what my first
something well you can make money off of
molding it's gonna make your place a lot
that actors
meaning and fulfillment
to actually hang your license with a
going to discuss is what most people
were incredible for me i did an um
character was originally written for
you better be very skilled at
you were in
that would have been a really poor
another audition i booked that role and
avengers endgame was not filmed in
obviously you can't go hunting for those
really nice bedroom I mean it's not the
got a call back for that
actually put down as low as three to
you should know that you can't reach the
and in my entire 13-year career i have
personal deadline of Thursday at noon
looking at one week I got bad news for
so let's first talk about what you
start auditioning for movies and
we don't know necessarily when we're
out and all of those things
here in the atlanta area but if you live
that doesn't necessarily mean that you
let's say you make an iOS game or
importantly you won't be a slave to your
shrink it down to the Cliff's Notes
just ready to rock it but right before
for their actors and that is again
concept of pay to play where you need to
means there is a lot of competition as a
to audition for
and professionals will have to say and
per gallon which is about 800 times more
tutorial on how to create an acting
the 12 steps you need to take to start a
more content like this
can see my screen is cracked because
in my residual payments over the course
six months if you don't have maybe
from the video from last week uh if you
better good to see you man well chat
when these students are taking these
getting an agent right away is going to
about it from an actor's standpoint and
looked and instantly elevated my
example one more time what if during the
there is to know about the business side
short for the role or too young or too
immerse yourself with every possible
what's listed here but i don't squeeze
in smaller markets it can be on the
something more modern while you are
it useful we'll talk about how to
this is where the owners spent the
have found are as close to unbreakable
these three go
also make money number one is
name is kurt yu thank you so much for
television production hub
idea about like when it came to
luck to get to the point where we can
demo reel now the rule of thumb
called to if it's something that you
and three we're creating demo reel
foremost to see for a good fit you know
brilliant or forward slash alley and the
making a living so that was point number
to jump start their career and i
have a beginning mark and an end mark
might be are you ready to hear what my
so if you're interested in learning
but I'll tell you more about them later
there are probably opportunities to act
what should you wear when you're walking
many of these workshops will give the
but hollywood the industry the industry
how to make money online to watch those
right so you make your mistakes and act
and then the results will be all the
i got as soon as i moved to a major
you're gonna have to accept that you may
to teach that working with a scene
want to know all of these terms before
of the camera
reason down below
as much commission from you when you do
London for work becomes a F Y a comma i
walk-in closet which is super nice tons
the reason i'm wearing this t-shirt
there is a good reason many people make
because they say
get rid of this habit it's going to be a
audition but
to discuss what i will be wearing for
calls it's more focused on you know we
right i didn't have time to finish this
feel the pressure to go full time in
to invest it properly
able to do in atlanta
yourself that's not going to teach you
i've yet to meet someone like that so
exist well there are certain projects
Doe I'm 45 years old
reels start off
other and I couldn't even I couldn't fit
right nutrition that their body needs so
or la then you could probably get by
separate entrance
let's say 300 megabits per second and
like i mentioned earlier
to get to the point where they're
don't have to go intense like super
for me that's how it ended up happening
honey wagon ready to do your seat
congratulations you guys watch this
may be ready to consider representation
outsourced as much as you possibly can
on the first try
real agent
size so we're actually going to drag it
i do know actors that have spent over a
the rhythm of the conversation when
this video subscribe to my channel all
decide to stop so that's why i want to
oftentimes they will give you a script
our own products if we're selling our
of acting and not just be in love with
a lot more in this video we are focusing
to know that marketing is so important
hours of the week's total of 168 hours
number 11 is
breakdowns they will then take those
learned how to make websites when I was
button and also subscribe to my channel
years ago I was in London for work so
into the overall loan so basically that
back because it's harder to kind of say
they look very modern and they're gonna
well because that one is a little bit
on this planet so if you're having
bring up the energy okay before we end
before you make a final decision of
it for this video if you liked it give
people can now buy anything with
that's me i was recently cast in a
if there's any questions specifically
least two years as your primary
you can definitely have a top tier
and in those cases i would recommend
differences are between being non-union
it shows the relationship between the
percentage that gets signed and gets
so those were three ways to show an
that first part of making money with
stuff that's like a dollar square foot
got a call back for that role
those are the sacrifices that
alright let's talk about self taping
they're going to tell you about roles
audition now in an ideal world
entrepreneur then you probably spend a
going on listing present
and it really filters down the people
self taping has become an absolutely
absolutely have to learn how to code but
uploading thousands and thousands of
subscription but yeah those are the
color like a a gray or a blue is best
the day before or the days prior because
step number 11 is to branch out to a
to your actual shoot on time they can't
don't get an agent right away
you can book more or do more
cheaper and
because they are they're maybe their top
maybe I just kind of move through it and
are the ones where i know the educators
right now that's how you stand out from
know maybe what they were doing or they
you can get them to laugh and break up
sheet you can get it by going to that
everybody gets
their bank accounts and they wonder
download my 10-step audition preparation
i don't know what it's like in other
crisis and now listen here y'all I can't
channel making content about their local
at your own pace so let's say you have a
actual commercial credits on your acting
just give you an example
a consistent
to be honest this is a really tough
negotiating multi-million dollar deals
online course it's going to be important
you know when when you're doing bicep
digital resume make sure that your
whether or not you got that from college
but to be completely transparent and you
onto my resume just to make it look
casting process so if we don't have
you just start out
of training
else supporting you
20% is just like some random number they
one better results financially two less
of others chicago
from memorization because you gotta know
that we're only talking about sag after
i make a ton of videos about personal
you're working so hard and you have
your services over the Internet now I've
physical goods are just not as fun to
better than the older people out there
on average about 6 to 12 months for an
agency that submitted they might only be
method and there's the actual expenses
it is the sign
they have to be doing a real service for
television section
so that's what i would encourage you
in the house that that you want to do
sure he did a great job and like all
if you haven't already please subscribe
that would be ridiculous wouldn't it so
it's probably gonna cost like a maybe
I've lived in Atlanta for a few years
and you don't have to pay any payroll
the air anymore
industrials and then moving into movies
started if you haven't already make sure
about next so cool because people
the right time for you
market if people search this and they
underneath this we're going to do this
autopay the instant you get a credit
on actors who have theater experience
all right we got a lot to cover in this
the bone with it and then my discs
but in the comments of that video i got
changes episode by episode so if you are
embarrassed and the thing is we never
link to getting 50 off flow desk down
the reason they asked this question
are opportunities to get better
headshots these days so it's important
acting auditioning and career advice
information they're going to work with
that link right there alright until next
alright so up here you have three
them rather than someone who just stands
know how to run the numbers so why do we
live outside of north america
it for 29.5
brilliant and in fact one way to justify
week i got a lot of
doctor on that show and i'm in episode
film project
with holding rental properties i just
have headshots that are printed on the
aftra and the cost for joining the union
win and the fact that you
with you my ten commandments of self
acting studios that have classes
because it's possible i think
been incredible for me and just being
audit sheet that you can download it
right from the get-go because they think
maintain our standard of living
posted casting calls on each website
to see more content just like this
longer to recover so go just before
free gym membership I was like you know
so you better be prepared all the time
lot harder
these normally have a better return and
awesome choices and you're just you're
movies and television shows
gonna want you to say there were
deleted scenes on disney plus so if you
recommend is that you learn how to code
because that process helped teach me
this can totally change your perspective
accelerated schedule
we don't have that progress in that
in the comments below until next time
overweight on the BMI scale I was 20
and you have booked the room because if
requirements you need to get your real
that's a huge win right you you are
soft white light it wasn't too yellow
like show business right well there's a
costs are just too high here and the
route this this kind of so much stuff
right it wasn't my demo reel in the
studio you would put
I'd recommend starting with the basics
some common spaces like the driveway the
very very rarely will i have more than
runs one about marketing and he shows
liked them both equally
right in theater is the only time where
disagree with me give me a thumbs down
artist's rendition of the frames for
means you can still
renting out that room for about 1400
people for access to the question back
one click of a mouse it's crazy but 40
were very resilient people and our body
Amazon affiliate links so when someone
way like she owns the place so that's a
industry so they know that if there's an
the movie has come out but I don't think
so start creating your own web series or
over actor in industrial videos
examples of times when my scenes were
is seven days on investment property but
you have to make sure to pay that off
do your paint
resume it's going to make you look like
and in la i know i know from experiences
basis and it was more of a psychological
that is currently on the air then you
actually most people find find homes
presentation matters your marketing
10 years
was in a commercial with shaq
then also keep an eye out for when they
determines your interest rates it
because I can't get that 20% right like
this new role that was written into the
whether you get cut or not
the rest of the cast remember that they
about today
care if it was avengers end game
champion and triathlon and duathlon in a
and that is voice acting voice actors
you learn the skills
or 3,000 K now personally we chose to do
weeks later they called my agent and
We Are The World We Will You Run Through
be taken
of using the paintbrush does play an
working 60 hours a week of being a
actor and you still get camera shy or
i mean that's the power of a network
most major cities have talent agents now
I've never auditioned for that casting
make a resume like this regardless of
is to submit a professional headshot
percent down they choose to invest their
and it's a big decision it shouldn't be
would be similar but they do have their
it takes a long time much longer than a
thing you need to know is that you need
profession in the world acting
kind of prepared for the scene
work that i've done
of ways that you can benefit from having
as low as 3% down conventional loans are
director but the important thing
basically what that means is when you're
mention here that i didn't hire anyone
on my first day that i worked as the
new york and atlanta
thing that wasn't sustainable for me
is even more valuable than the on-set
strategies if it is something where you
think of that can help you make yourself
can sustain I think what you just said
pretty quickly that ultimately what I
let's say you have 10 or 15 commercials
and fun in a way that really
in order to start working with you if
the audition was for
is your job as an actor because we can
hold for X amount of days or you're
the production side but i'm not i'm not
is a huge question that so many people
that hundred thousand dollar profit
find a part-time job or another
time keep practicing keep learning and I
standing out of frame off camera who is
when i was just starting out
i think i auditioned two or three times
in full costume for an audition hey like
doing scene work
produced by
I'm gonna put that link down in the
on your own create your own film uh by
having the the leader of the mastermind
they're probably not going to get people
could have gone so then if you could do
because that's what I wanted to talk
that is going to impact so many people
what's the difference okay well if you
who are so successful that don't do that
not gonna look good at all so make sure
first of all congratulations but don't
next term is take a take simply refers
straight to the government as
financial struggles that they would
license to have because you're going to
acting career how much does it cost to
today's topic i want to talk to you a
dreams you want your help in pursuing a
learning a bunch of monologues is
and that's the nice thing about live
or you did an in-person course they
maybe you didn't do anything wrong
today we're talking about different ways
television shows
can anyways thank you so much again and
already purchased a home
and as soon as i posted that video last
three to six months of an emergency fund
audition in on time how can they trust
most dishes for big waves and
resume looked like this when i first
you have done a commercial for competing
some people like to use a bedsheet or a
pressing to push play and pause every
are two completely different skills just
feeling super confident because of how
off I will go as far as to turn off my
people like MA and I and I'm very guilty
anywhere now let's move on to the next
but i am saying just look for these
television show and i shared a couple
when you're just starting out you
basically two ways of selling it like we
things that I learned through three
desperate to
don't really get to see them but for
sleep so like I have to force myself to
license and after that you'll be able to
hear what you are using remember to
if you're renting out a room on airbnb
it all down it just helps me internalize
another administrative assistant so
very cheap they range from maybe like 50
yes i really want to be an actor and i'm
working in the corporate world and
guarantee that you will book the role in
your career
that your real estate license is a great
like the movie hard to kill where
file mistake number two not printing on
can sometimes feel so let's break it
well as the big lesson that i learned
lunch but I can't remember exactly which
that link is in the description below
and the reason why i say that it was an
description below if you're at all
waking up early and
ten total coal degrees so like maybe
in some of the studies is around 75 000
like none of this existed which is
let's get started the first thing you
film and television production markets
actually do want to mention one other
trust your gut like you know if if
can be
i know many actors who have gotten
convenient because you just go there
and now you have to go try to scrap and
character of george on the show
said you could check out their website
around one dollar it's gonna look great
always looking for
actually go out and get multiple quotes
coming in and one you don't have a
basketball we just always were active
can you purchase for me what can you
and seeing the prices of homes increase
if you're doing it just more for
that is not an option for a lot of
estate license if you have any questions
most common terms that you will hear at
you're thinking oh man I just went on
especially like artists and makers and
having an email list especially for my
okay now that we have a photo printer
so today let's talk about exactly how
maths science and computer science the
file that you got back from the
estate agents don't want to pay for
my audition cheat sheet and it's my way
happy with it so I actually put a link
of today
too you can find
opinion getting a real estate license is
couple of years until you're 18 and
fulfillment and satisfaction and value
monologues suck
then the power is kind of in your hands
feedback they can give you a critique
photo paper this is different from
okay those were 10 ways you can make
hey you are on first refusal if you
are other people in the industry that
book your first few auditions that has
which i enjoy making phone with friends
make sure that the city you're investing
industry standard so make sure your
more money for a production to go
so what's what is something that you can
it's a millions of dollars of risk
but guess what this is the cost of doing
about moving to atlanta for your acting
opens a lot of doors for you
you take are of great addition to great
are things that you should be doing
building up that downpayment as long as
was already living
impulsive now to combat this
always fair like this credit score
please give it a thumbs up and
because it was in the middle of the
can play mozart on the violin
Netflix shows that most people are
story of disney world project i glad you
casting standpoint what the casting
self tape auditions
likely have a personal car
and knew what they were doing the scene
so i didn't really have the financial
okay the second big takeaway i want to
should make the switch and when you
when you decide to do so all right we
that has like dim lighting that is dark
you're saying the words back and forth
what loan program is right for you now i
of the time or more breakdowns only go
addition with mine advised to the
while they're getting the lights and
say stick with something safer so yeah
trying to start an
ever get yourself take so much audition
work on are safe and that they get
every audition is yes it is an audition
resume for film and television by the
1,000 true fans where if you can just
step 11 the final casting decision now
instead of single-family residences
before I go to sleep it's not the last
have to do any in those ads I mean I
doesn't it doesn't make sense so you
absolutely know them reading the
the extended warranty option extended
coffee shop worker on this new disney
so here are six steps that you can take
industry standard is to print our
you've done then i'll hire you to create
so that he could help us learn how to
back to the casting director for a
but they don't
you can do to make the feeling of being
they are adding valley to the house and
cabinets can be either an easy fix or
check them out i will put a link to them
up and if you haven't already
of them are related to doing stuff on
look professional that speaks to how
buying it five days later i went back to
that you can put into your solo 401k
passive income or some type of side
want to make sure that it's clear i'm
it also applies to anyone who wants to
better the triplex has twice as many
because if you can teach something and
atlanta georgia for example
just very much extreme you know a walk
auditions you've got to get better at
hey guys what's up in this video i'm
talking to Tyler during this interview
in these types of projects the more
meals in bulk to save money so i always
but understand that theater acting
this book by Harold Gus Caen called how
impossible to take those next steps
maybe a few thousand dollars of mortgage
I wake up it's the first thing I do
and you'll have an additional 25
possible to study it's definitely not
performance yet I've waited till the end
atlanta here in the southeast
world to push us along
websites such as
external microphones when I'm taping an
of self taping tools in the description
products I mean things like ebooks or
class you can
of clothes they'll wear it maybe a few
was really helpful and for you to see
how it works is you can basically deduct
whatever it is it might not be in your
got an audience of people that you can
go attend a conference visit a client or
this is no different than someone trying
weird actor lifestyles
specifically to the name of the file
and I will continue preaching that
anyone's watching and it's interested in
the point where you have it maybe about
short film or to try to make an
television industries
then watch for what they are posting
i chose 300 because i want to save some
them for me and she knows my brand voice
if your face is not seen on camera that
making the casting decisions are much
seeing partner but
of making money on the internet now 13
that you read is called profit first and
sure on that because i'm not a theater
completely outside of his control so I
start talking about what these things
health and fitness into that type of
if your bathroom has like those old pink
three more weeks go by i didn't hear
this mindset
get three
be preparing learning as much as you can
okay so those are two lines on a resume
know when a relationship is gonna pay
and build it piece by piece we're
i knew that i wanted to get into real
patient there's no reason to immediately
awareness of how my body moves
have to have some type of balance to
through what these 12 things are
in the comments of my other videos that
as much money as possible so let's get
body starts shaking you're like what's
book over fifty movies and television
of PMI you pay is also based on your
activities because everything we do can
generally an
it takes mental strength it takes thick
there's and there's nothing wrong with
have quit
expertise and that's where i've really
okay so that was a shorter version of
in the next one
per month in rental income and if you
all the time so they filmed all of
first impression so what makes a good
at in this is using just bodyweight you
the next choice that you're gonna have
ever have PMI for the entire third year
obviously any amount of money that we
to see if a
code usually want to find some
for prioritizing your salary over
to tax you on up to 250 000
or by clicking the link down in the
and it might be a little controversial
a free 10-step audition preparation
around to complete focus was seamless
have a good of a score as someone that's
my career has come in the last five
duffer brothers
photography through my online education
know where to find them
once or twice a month i see agents and
sometimes those breakdowns will be sent
very different and then you have the
audition let's get to it
so lucky to have the internet and one
my t-shirt if you don't recognize this
to the camera out of frame and you are
the bedroom should not be the focus of
and i'll say this too let me just use
audition at all
loan term of 30 years
sell to as a guy called Gary Vaynerchuk
run it like a business and just like any
than if i had bought
that you take
get your own real estate license that's
audition or set like they know and so I
a production
you're first getting started you are
and then other days you get to the honey
is doing film competitions now there are
um and you're at that tipping point
however the good news is that i'm
that the agents most most of them if
when it comes to auditions props are no
out and throw a 100 bill away right and
learning and i hope to see you on set
character and then she asked me do you
it's just a very complicated process
elementary school
biggest difference here is that union
and millions of dollars and escape the
was going to be a part of this
self-taping in recent years so
how i prepare for my auditions
and i really just want to encourage you
shipping I also don't like the fact that
don't want in the
there are three bedrooms including one
serious about it and i'm really good and
plays in the community this obviously is
you don't have because you don't have
free audit that you can get by clicking
is the most important thing and i know a
1080p for your auditions if you happen
higher and that's gonna add a lot of
spending a lot more money than we really
you know what we don't think you're
you're paying taxes upfront and with the
multiple scenes or you worked on
was a male they wanted to go with a
you're watching this video you're
this industry is it depends
stuff it'll help with making the
starbucks and dropping five dollars on a
industry term that we don't know because
some kind of value that someone else is
other casting platform so it'll be
that group setting who really would
three column format now i'm going to
submitting to an agent the second way to
agent's experience comes into play and
highest grossing movie of all time
you can add some personality but if your
to my channel to see more content just
what it means to be a sag after a member
you can see how a major movie or a
filmed in hollywood the best example of
do for your career
every audition that i get how i make
diet free beat trap the game by going to
on the props versus no props to be I
leave me to where i am today we work on
going to give you a hard time so
never asked me
made a few months ago about
buying products like clothes food
you're buying a place and you're
do plumbing we say
production a zero cost of reproduction
going to be on that show until they
of course not and that's what it's like
license later on or eventually become a
this process works
else that you think might find this
and they hire actors as well so this is
landscaping working on the bathrooms
the states
going to be needing audition experience
did was we took dusk photos and dust
actually grow your business you want
in order to pass your real estate
you don't want to be a one-hit wonder
compare that to the
work on a project whether it's a movie
finances in place to do it where if
felt like they had been doing it for
will pass if you go through all their
now if you don't have tv credits right
and all the different factors you should
then there are going to be some
that see place online that looks good
make in their lifetime so a lot is
to answer based on your own life but I
hopefully i would have been cast in a
record your audition for you edit it and
but i encourage you to watch this whole
interacting with another human being
get into shape but you I think you
was really smart for what you were
both times i never got to meet him maybe
or digital goods then your ability to
participated in taking notes just like
this is not going to provide exposure
beneficial from a full nutrient
is not in stunts it can still be a great
you're being paid nothing or you're
you through everything allowing you to
number 10 the final commandment is to
what's the best place to live to start
net income is a hundred thousand dollars
my suggestion
this case you know we put the house on
it is pretty scary not having money in
called dopesick on hulu i also play a
to join in
focus on learning first after a while
down I heard him say first team
very small percentage gets signed and
and to make sure that the sets that they
focused on
separate home office room it also needs
26 i didn't do any acting before i was
perks like that when you are signing up
actors can only work on union
tv resume having theater credits stuff
stuff but there's no other things like
college nearby that has a filmmaking
time investment
and you'll have no problem on the test
there are some other costs that veteran
for a final casting decision
really trust that person and they really
director's office we wait in a waiting
being a youtuber or whatever it is i
bunch of sites like hotpads and trulia
play -back rose rapidly without you wanna
and watching this type of stuff
being paid like 50 bucks or 100 bucks to
alright I'll see you guys in the next
that has helped me to this very day
and then I'm gonna walk kind of around
hire to guide you along this home buying
the thing that we're trying to sell them
and skill
down but if you hold a squat for 10
back when I first started is there any
or if let's say it was on camera class
app that makes money but if you're a
a brand new actor who's just starting
too many people in your category at that
callback then i got put on first refusal
that situation is
hey actor you have just booked the role
so check that out and maybe i come back
get your license you will need some
exactly how the casting process works
career to pursue and it takes
exact coverage this literally only took
one of them or and it's like you gotta
productions do so for non-union
and you know we
know two to six hours at a time and
actual health and fitness routine around
doing that I want to introduce you to
united states i know in other countries
if you play a character like yoda
every single week alright today we're
headshots are done
you know sometimes it takes people
be a principal performer in the movie
actual audition for a commercial
invest in your headshot because it is
and while you won't make as much money
running the line so you're gonna do this
and making sure you got it you gotta be
for co-star guest star recurring or
hey guys so you clicked on this video
look at some of the oscar-winning actors
ever worked on I appeared in season 8
business and i personally love it it's a
other costs associated with holding
an accelerated depreciation on that
but even just think about other
forgoing investing that money right now
both in your business and in your
student films or short films things like
that much closer to booking all right
and she mumbled over to the groom and
the actor is the person auditioning who
and that is to maybe go to a photography
borrowing $500,000 let's say that you
thank you for watching and if you
for the generic name of the product take
they've already started
the when the script was originally
getting into an acting class so that you
hundred dollars you give them 10 you
want to make sure that we go into these
creators and photographers and
so in order to help you avoid making the
and not be brand specific for example if
one year you drive 10
300 megabits per second internet and
video in my trailer so we are finishing
the weight and then start running again
you walk out the door and you left them
audition opportunities or
commercial auditions is a different
the three things that he says actors
dreams of newbie actors who haven't done
now if i'm an agent
with this YouTube channel since 2017
actually gonna have
179 using bonus depreciation
casting directors the advice that I've
and look believable in a college
again and if meal planning is something
going to be talking about
parts I might be too old for some parts
then gets shot and killed he would just
functional movement standpoint I am I am
extended period of time and now they're
driving by
so i've been a working actor for almost
but you will have to pay every single
filmmaking communities and see if you
the lines right while focusing on
pandemic the production was following
definitely go for it but there are
you're spending in your personal life
all of those types of experiences on
business owner there's just so many
are working actors just like me
calling door knocking passing out flyers
how extravagant your life is or not
some taping services that will
because I was so in my head about the
books if you're going to attend seminars
i got over a hundred auditions for
review the content the last thing you
i want to be
designer and get hired by companies
doing that that we are amateurs so this
you've given them for free over an
of people will not recommend this
an audition you have control over all
say fifty dollars to two hundred dollars
help banks and lenders give out
questions or if there are any audition
get excited to talk about her so you
that I learned and
have these different life styles of
agents are sending those auditions
unions if you are a member of say
calm now before I get into my thoughts
Oh died uh I like um I like I like
and making it your mission to read them
non-union now let's talk about how to
a lot of money with these types
has one printable side I like printing
what if you already live in california
don't photoshop the heck out of them to
year old 27
for a movie and television show
that's exactly what we did
everyone is going to have learned
just kind of kept popping up over here
uh your online casting profiles filled
your first time here first of all
starting out we have no idea if
so we're making fifty pounds without
main ones that i like to look at
in your unit and have your three tenants
business works
for myself and so it was like you know
based on what we've seen
important for people to understand of
your bedroom and you're showing that
this is not going to pay you
time in your business set or it just
let's say the director's name was donna
human being rather than to
doing both
to like my eight email contact and told
certain online banks such as ally
duplex you can only rent out one unit
of guy and then I'm going to I'm gonna
a lot lower than yours probably and if
you know Monday Wednesday and Friday if
normal job or normal other activities
should be a professional headshot taken
write off that reduce your taxable
save easily 20
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
it needs to have your union status
hundreds or even thousands of actor
who has been trained to express the
then you may need some professional
here's another thing that you should
you in the pretty much highest bracket
who have already done all of the
that you can find people to pay you for
let's get to it self taping commandment
an agent is expensive
they're kind of considered on a level
of finding tenants screening them
all the expression changes anything
the actor will make a percentage of that
you need and take that class it's not
dollars I'll do it for five dollars I
as you can see we're not in my normal
you'll just kind of make money and a
lead guest star
that work in the film and television
it it totally would make sense if that
I would like my words um but he talked
so many acting classes are available via
sheet if you're interested in
directors on this line
consider the fact
sell access to that like for example
it so
000 after living there for two years the
this industry whenever there's a big
business expenses so
on your resume like this if you were the
funds ready just in case something
inexpensive photo printer options
school and you're currently working a
tempting to go with the fastest one
standpoint and so you know if you're in
live on zoom so not in person again
actors in ohio
a little recorder like this and not just
a job as that was to to not accept it
agent in order to move forward in your
business no matter if you're an online
lose money from doing a home inspection
instagram reels because that's what's
either a union member or a non-union
with money its subtitle is nine steps to
october 9th and then i self-taped my
performers and they make a great living
the ways that they ask these questions
doctor gives you their business card and
your location of your property
might be having classes or workshops
actor then you believe that any money
of actors say that they want to act in a
you have control over that and that can
for a bank account
like in all the different aspects of
friends family everyone they know should
it a lot harder to purchase things that
I only named a few but these are some of
is like getting a pizza you just
all right the third step to getting your
is on camera the reader is the person
i thought that type of thing only
says here is the copy for your character
do you have consistent income coming in
guaranteed that they're gonna throw it
that you can go and audition for one of
and even if you do have some experience
one of the main characters on that show
of us we're not making a living
lead character in a marvel movie they
what happened and now i'm currently
specifically to each individual person
also subscribe to my channel to see more
in cleveland ohio
so the point is this uncapped income is
show set so once our number is called we
and talk about the details of what we
people tell us that they're good actors
things were laid out or things were
might get the occasional client from
two masterminds now both of those have
projects however they are still very
you're going to have to learn monologues
the actors that live in atlanta or live
sometimes you got to take that unpaid
personally our water heater just like
into my email list and growing it has
the final casting decision they may have
per month so one thousand one thousand
thing that you have is your name and big
when the project is shooting the rate of
to see what my acting ability was and
someday move to the united states no
answer probably is yes
thousands and thousands of dollars per
that you'll pass read the question try
with and i am cheering for you and
another really fun thing about becoming
promise you working on a scene together
get a role in a movie immediately the
my first audition and my callback and
telling you is these are the actions and
and then you can also start getting some
only use those atms because they won't
can and willing to do
reel immediately this is the way to
it's hard when you
is that it is a film competition that's
know like and trust you and by far the
headshots done and not to settle for the
course once and then it's just selling
so don't submit for projects in toronto
are pretty low which makes it one of the
get that going so if you will be sure to
moment that you finish
start date necessarily hopefully soon
yep well and that's and again it it goes
day that I was there than on any other
kicking around and the process of
audition if you have an audition for a
that could match those expenses you have
impact on your overall portfolio so if
Next In Happy With What Your Plan In
now anytime I get asked that tell me
mortgage your rent your utilities
this is a huge decision and should not
for people that are interested in it so
better now if you're interested in
complete control over in our careers and
google drive i'll put the link down in
if this is your first time here make
students student filmmakers many
area that the house is in because you
was pinned for the role they were
important during escrow and that's why
second way we're going to talk about
down and transcribe this whole this
theater section
there are other unions here in the
get rid of those nasty walls and get
seriously a lot of these generic brand
and i have no regrets
the lines off the page by yourself all
and then that's something that I think
therefore there are so many points where
if it's your first time here make sure
and then you can maybe inch by inch get
classmates are going to be some of the
this is the reality of the life of an
right and you want a job
in industrial videos and industrial
business just as a whole
becoming a professional actor requires
stuff and they're gonna get you a
that's right okay that's it for this
and work on both sides now if you are
so when you book a role on a television
change you might be too tall for some
tell me about yourself question and an
every single week now today's video is
business and you have thirty thousand
invested in the bay area early or even
in fact I'm actually helping a family
now if you do a great job with this mock
the fico score is what
current score sorted out before you
about how likely we are to book an
about real estate in fact it's going to
you're totally cool right you turn this
if i want to hire a professional
already and remember there's that list
of buckingham fitness I asked Tyler how
interest payments to your overall loan
the perfect job if you like helping
others so now i'm going to take you guys
it's because that whole initial appeal
right from the beginning but it should
over those notes main thing I really
paying taxes on any profit that you make
yeah i was trying to get auditions for
perfect um i have a video on using
episode 12 prior to that it had already
getting late auditions quite frequently
our members so in other words sag-aftra
how many actors are auditioning for the
i guarantee you it's gonna taste exactly
lot of the oscar-winning and emmy
how much does an agent cost i think
see you on set one day
your face and brings out your
so learn how to audition learn how to
want to join now and start back at day
closing deals can be very sporadic
want to live with college students house
you're a couple hours away from a major
are being submitted just to get
your drink for you
city and every state i don't know what
document and you can follow along as i
those habits when you don't have the
you've read the summaries of
10 to 20 years this happens between the
investing is through rental income and
to pursue your acting career if you move
and it can be lower or higher but you
lights that are in your ceiling and are
forces us to think about
auditions like what we're talking about
if everybody's saying the same thing how
be something that you'd be
so they only tell people on a need to
have your contact information
need to kind of get the blood flowing
startup costs are in the first couple
actually like one of the highest
properties as investments then you might
great decision
owner you are entitled to
really nice and they're luxurious but
if dressing for the role helps you get
process that I use that has helped me
whether i was in the show or not it is
it becomes pretty dangerous because no
or 12 years I was like I can handle this
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
think about when you're considering
productions are looking for someone who
comes to the very end
harder to build those routines and build
football player who's you know stacked
and use that as a closing cost for
Mountain people would be like oh my gosh
it is very easy to get your license like
uniform is what booked her the role but
try to create a separate entrance as
channel so in that old video I explained
hope to see you on set one day
entire video because look i know this is
in-person class so I definitely do
fantastic way of doing that is by taking
pretty stagnant and you're really
heard of that
now leading up to your test date you
online education so if you can teach
do you drive a lot for business you'll
perfect for and we'd like to book you
gonna be a lot less than for a more
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
all the time in this industry and union
year they quit they go back to their
Sears to get it done
actors union we'll go over questions
if i go into an audition and i don't
well I actually have two answers one for
the city you live in right now even if
that's insane
learn the skills you need
little bit but
super easy fix all you have to do is buy
all right you've probably been wondering
so an acting studio you can expect to
and help you
what happens a lot is that the character
atlanta's initiation fee
and when you do that you can write off
painting the place you might as well
you'll know how to run numbers that tell
student films and short films and
in a project
might have thrown me off so here's what
interpretation of the tax code
uh community theater student films
house hack is to buy a fixer-upper for
your name at gmail.com whatever it is
description to the specific page on the
realized this when i was just getting
show two of the main characters it was
on your bidding strategy i've heard
interested in learning how i audition
looking at and yeah you don't want to
to put your camera on a tripod no matter
you guys can use but those are the two
wealth and it's to build money
one of the producers told me he said hey
involved and getting your feet wet and
doing the homework and practicing your
and and not to find that not to you know
have a huge advantage it's very hard for
like this entire backyard was just grass
i'm doing another hotel room video today
acting classes when they are starting
yes history hand appears
appear a couple times in season one and
again kind of
spend money on the right things
have a lot of connections number five is
name of the director so as we see
Facebook ads some Instagram ads but in
really want to make money online then we
doesn't necessarily work like that and
way to show them that you are going to
right for me my faith is really
starting from the very beginning
classes which brings up step number two
and we want the cost of reproduction to
and television shows in their home
so many things that you guys can learn
to go to class every day and you know
for that was because we were still in
industry too
book because that's the ratio that free
mailing list of 20,000 people who know
and theater just i mean it simply makes
could have made because especially when
ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse
in your
for and what can you do to stand out
learning and i hope to see you on set
in full character because it's just not
energy we're exchanging for this ipad or
back to one of my goals am I trying to
aren't too expensive if you go to either
because this is show business
and certainly
charge you any money up front
think about which is that
the actual exam because this is where
remember this is just how you get
to help us live happier more productive
firstly teach yourself HTML and CSS
at all so after the zoom callback
within the industry itself how we make
when i wanted to actually go full-time
details that are different from case to
involving the actors yet this is
something even easier than that instead
about the legitimate things that you
experience in graphic design i knew
years to get an accepted offer depending
that have been taken out of the full
actors equity for example then you are
know how much you should be paying who
if this is your first time here hit that
if janet starts throwing around reckless
the local economy price the rent ratios
so if you hear about a role that you
be a jpeg file
making a cameo in something they like to
of helping you prepare for your audition
camera to see somebody with some life in
roles in the movie
recommend is going online buying a book
weights is my overall like
the only time you pay your agent is
product so oftentimes the prop is the
your equity and part of that goes to
of a resume and that is pretty much it
they considered me too far away from
side someone on your team
using tape that's either in a form of an
every time that commercial plays meaning
shopping for your loan
that we have to take in order
late in paying a medical utility or
becoming a full-time business owner
video then i assume that you have
projects and say ah I'll do it for ten
also says to suggest the character but
really experienced mentor who can guide
seen this approach work for some actors
did in 2015 we both know how to code and
the script but it was talked about not
if you needed to see a doctor let's say
okay what am I gonna do to fill that
where a traditional classroom run by a
is atm fees atm fees on average can go
we don't engage
and in this video i want to share with
scene but it is part of your audition
because if that's what you love then
get ninety dollars
particular union
can help you fill out those forms
those things we talk a lot about like
oscar winner sean penn so that happens
people have been doing this for many
audition you're never just auditioning
that i have made the third investment
but the rental rate is only about six
else in different state then the basic
city that you want to invest in because
ultimately they decided that because the
say you're spending x dollars and
and then we would put the director so
with that food so you know I'm gonna go
from somewhere if you happen to have
consumer too because it allows them to
to that graphic designer example
I if this is my routine mhm
you are already working hard because the
course is generally gonna cost a bit
quarantine you had already started
and that has turned out to be a really
important because it's gonna make your
especially right now third pro of house
if you want to become an actor on
really get that knowledge
all those things let's say you're even
state to buy rental properties now if
some reverse lunges or some push ups
now shooting the show and i got another
second way to get started in
know you're a runner you probably want
a lot of my previous videos of making
live your life you know and so so I'm
move why can't they cast me
website templates included and i was
georgia is a right to work state so in
one i want to make sure you understand
the sides for the day the sides for the
trying to figure out whether or not you
three a digital version of your headshot
email was literally created like
don't buy as much clothes
didn't lose weight and you just keep
that I coach along with and they're the
it actually ends in november of 2021
educator is incredible and that they are
about this how about this what if the
now you can sell goods now you can sell
but because I'm the closest one to him
because actors so if you need to know
post those auditions publicly why do
to print our first headshot but before
stimulus but you're not as taxing you
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
them now the goal here isn't to follow
prove to an agent that you're going to
auditions there will be no blocking
they end up paying
because every once in a while agents and
let's take me back to the wall sits in
can you stand out from the crowd
loan when you have a mortgage and you're
figuring out and doing you know no
that pops up in their minds when they're
in the comments below
easier if you have a smaller file size
and this is where an inexperienced actor
put all the headshots of their top
plays or doesn't have anything that you
when i lived in ohio i never wanted to
all the way across the country to
seasons where we feel like we are not
every single week as a working actor in
the type of job that's where you might
back to audition for another role
get a really good feel of the lay
research those on your own but as far as
only two union jobs you can work on 3 4
a professional actor you're not doing
that they are today
that's how we shot the entire thing
the people that you know it's the people
i tell them to start looking at
when someone doubts me or even when i
there are some
that i use
I like to add an activity now while I'm
another easy ish one to learn is video
these houses are so expensive and it's
more and more stuff we buy and then the
find out right time in each of those
close I can smell it now the last thing
casting platforms are actors access and
I've been following Gary Vaynerchuk for
they tend to keep it a secret and tend
act so that leads me to acting studios
that already speaking of links in the
Thursday kind of a toss-up so let's just
would come down to the performers that
how much you're taking your career
okay I'm ready I can't find Brandon
a big time actor i have to make my
about 30 minutes of my time
when you're buying and selling your own
of the business
so many kind of online courses that seem
dedicated to actors and filmmaking all
on money so for example let's say you
only one short scene
really liked and he was their top choice
great lessons learned and it also just
to be all over the place some months you
want to hire actors for their print ads
california will probably rent out for
forward to in the future
on the Vampire Diaries at least on the
show them don't tell them that you're
content to know how a lot of these
sure you have a quiet set we all know
in Final Cut and after working through
companies can charge as much as 30
around 200 something dollars again check
probably can't see anything but I'll run
yeah definitely build that nest egg
you can depreciate them on an
tons of film competitions
aware of that now if you're looking for
bedroom while debating whether or not to
another task as well then you know
but you and you don't want to live too
book the part so make sure you are
retailers that
section and then i write
test is gonna be a hundred fifty
exhausting day and you feel like having
in the same room where they didn't want
your own hours and do whatever you want
markets like los angeles or new york if
set in mind that you want to achieve for
talent agents a few months ago i made a
herniated and I was still eating all the
video right here where I talk about the
audition we're kind of trying to show
nervous when you're in front of the
making it at home you actually have to
jab is when you give someone content and
let me see oh no it was a week later a
nice view and of course the walk-in
my name is Kirk you super happy to be
that's in addition to
kudos to you you're going to go out
think of your brain as a tool that can
from your s corp if your kid is over 18
anyway even if you feel like you don't
get a check in the mail at some point in
for instance i've done a ton of acting
expensive what we chose to do is replace
videos just like this
headshot that was not taken
finite number of ways that they can ask
it's because they have decades of
there to people around your area yeah
is because they
on tv or whatever it may be so
than I expected next time you're gonna
just never bought it but then I recently
course or you can also choose to do your
starbucks versus making it at home
of it I always try to find a way to
and if it wasn't one of the ones I
interested in joining my brokerage we're
you need a new roof
i always compare this to like imagine
thing that you guys might be wasting
it in so many other videos and i'm going
fee or you know you can do it yourself
like button if you like this video and
zero capital gains tax on the profit
I who don't have the 20% down needed to
absolutely not focus on anything in the
of the producers on the movie
we'll also
actors and then they extend auditions to
different services and the max speed for
something that's really important to
because you are never forced to
and the network for a movie
listening and responding
20% so don't feel like you are one of
as an artist
specifically two things acting in the
for Instagram and tick tock your
an actor and from all the other actors
especially because we have all these
you're learning all the same information
your resume even though it is a film and
the love and share it with all of your
doing our face needs to be well lit for
actually able to quit my day job and
finished my audition the casting
because it lets people experience the
to the area and they should be an expert
specifically what exactly are agents
leave it all up to chance we said before
you so much for watching and if you
in movies and tv shows too when i worked
to start auditioning for the major
standpoint that's all you've broken 22
not get to see normally and by becoming
extra we're talking about auditions for
professional headshots
and make it look real that can be a
typically used in the commercial world
your interest rate the higher your score
no matter what kind of business or brand
in fact the next phase of exam prep is
give me a thumbs up remember to
kill where Steven Seagal was a
us he showed me the desk the police
probably have a better shot than some of
Python and
little bit um so as my business has
ask who likes i received and sword of
and simply because of the sheer numbers
most important business relationship in
that new actors need to learn that
all kinds of stuff
you have the dining space the dining
see a commercial for a product or a
planning help certainly but it does go
you see even small markets like my
the really important parts look at the
that tipping point where you can't keep
missing out on those huge gains of
off of
essential skill for any actor who wants
way to start getting involved in
youtube video
would have happened had i started at a
with 30 minute minutes be enough it
a specialist like a dermatologist and
majority of professional acting work
so that's why you gotta have experience
to subscribe to this channel to get more
and then even after he retired i watched
didn't have to go to work would we still
robinson who after we did this episode
please give it a thumbs up and if you
year for the stuff that you make you're
the room now if you have never heard the
not need to go through one of those big
and it shouldn't be taken lightly
headshot of you
whatever it is sides refers to pages
well that means that if such a movie
the business you can be doing plays to
time getting an agent
passes along that offer to the actor and
it comes to their headshots but today
acting is not an
would just put
taught actors to take the attention off
television shows
are always on the MLS looking at new
your demo reel
I put them side-by-side the headshot
suit you the best it's really this whole
and I hope to see you on set with day
together with your friends and filming
is not focusing on tracking your deals
and yeah i want you guys to know that
just free information on the Internet
that's it for today until next time keep
later that day so i think the callback
wear the full Jersey with the hat and
market after calm and today we're going
honestly when you have financial freedom
meaning your all in cost is going to be
imdb page and it's right there i'll put
and fitness into their lives so before
this journey certainly won't be easy in
the description of this video so you can
mobilizing the whole of your life from a
your real estate agent's time and yeah
immediately start acting in a marvel
for a lot of actors because we hear that
so that is when i will be watching the
was i lived way too far away
and being union
summary of your whole
he was someone that everybody knew now
that my sister and I went through as we
products like there is the paper like
and you feel like you just can't keep up
ever asked me to do a monologue who
career and be remembered I'm really glad
independence which sounds a bit like
instructions oftentimes when you get a
your happiness
know if your goal is to run five miles
first 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 auditions
price properties really expensively then
studying for
table in that
money every week every month by selling
that will hopefully help you in your
you're given a set of circumstances and
platform for interactive courses on
at the drop of a hat this is a very
in the details what i want you guys to
to become an accountant
a second time at the very end of the day
nobody can teach you how to become
recovered a little bit more now I can
are also looking at the real person
fit into the industry so where should
even up to 100 homes before they get an
interesting way online
can add up to
one-on-one support and feedback from you
actors make all kinds of mistakes when
teenage years or early 20s i don't think
thanks guys for watching these are
want you guys to know how important
just such a cool thing to think about
little bit too much for you yeah like
now finally the actor comes into play
of neighborhoods are going to do well
meisner technique because from day one
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
to agents and will not be posted
pieces of content by this day or i'm
business or do you have consistent
income legally then make sure to
products did you guys know that
so i grabbed my headshot and resume i
just learning how to do everything i
ability because
film programs and if they do have a film
generic brand products that are much
talk or anything like that
home and the
to help you pursue your acting career
want to share with you my own personal
important it was until my freshman year
i highly encourage you to get onto those
know if you have things you want to
ideal product category then is digital
want people
access and start finding and submitting
experience can get to the
creativity and potential revenue and
so www.yourname.com whatever your
directors lose trust in you because if
right there on the spot
and yes that's where a lot of production
but an email list is also just so
19.5 000
real estate full time try and find that
get the investment property rented out
high because they're not going to spend
valuable content for free and a right
should be paying for when you're
like 100 bucks normally but they have
television world it is not part of your
school through college and beyond and in
performers in
warranty periods are generally for
and start looking for auditions on those
a reason why you should a couple of
pro account put your demo reel on there
and through the platform they could do
don't need an agent right away in fact
the united states
CSS thingy that I made for my mates dad
prior work but this is where there's
there are so many loan programs out
on one of your parents cards now you
and that side hustle eventually evolved
in and i made probably six or seven
to do for your audition when they tell
but in smaller markets like atlanta
some of the actors that they really
it shows right there
the acting career center here to help
a good lesson
other character so when Jordan Brown
don't have the money to get into acting
streaming services that i pay for
push-ups that's great doing them slowly
is investing in ourselves investing in
employer contribution so let's say again
because of all of those other things
it's important not to go to a talent
necessary here's my advice
so grateful that you guys are following
might not go through the Starbucks
the casting process sometimes those
doesn't pay as well as film and
conventional loan you can actually put
should be doing and what you can be
and be this piece of clay maybe not so
i say hey
sure you got those lines down rock-solid
you're trying to pursue an acting career
small market
the acting career center here to help
how much you spend in your business how
something they're not gonna push you
you care about making money online and
how to tell that whole story now if
it makes it so that it's the only thing
you were an actor in the movie and your
one role
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
me a thumbs up if you haven't already
if you like this video give it a thumbs
and you'll save some money that way also
be forced to join the union so
purchase a house or sell their existing
the printer that I use is a Canon and it
one day
built you don't
have to do your own
exponential phase of investing now
you're only qualified for about like
this means that your monthly mortgage
access and casting networks and things
is how i
get a thousand people following you on
how do you join well you have to pay an
looking for homes this is the boring
you do
mortgage insurance just like the
we speak of your netflix disney wait
they're going to say well show me some
when my eyes open and I'm still in bed
found this video
yeah i hope you guys found this video
while investing in real estate the first
frustrating when something goes wrong
now you can use these methods to find
and outs of how to do affiliate
my first place as well as to help
family residence so that's why it's
to perform one of my monologues
I mean yes the most important part of an
graph because if it took you 30 years to
productions they may
how our body moves and they have really
your acting ability is and if you can
they may use different websites so put
example let's say
current city you can start by training
audition i'm not 45 or i'm not
a blog about productivity tips and every
shooting with other photographers
the audition room I was running the
uh depending on what market you're in a
footage for all of us to put on our demo
Sport And Prove Your Love Me This Way
value and renovating it now if you're
really get to show that reacting part of
someone that's negotiating for you who
proper benefits just like
might be asking now well the question
how to use their bodies from a
younger age
wagon and you go right to set they get
platforms oh and if you remember in my
because i don't fit this character
servicemembers and there
it I hear myself during these workouts
people will buy your paid stuff but only
you want to make sure that when you go
marketing tool as an actor now I've seen
actually have a conflict during these
definitely want to subscribe to this
if you think that bookshelf is worth a
to renovate it
private mortgage insurance all right so
public casting websites now in north
this is the will of working and
and if you're in a small town where
shows that don't go
here's not worse so the first thing we
or if a streaming service uh picks up
try to get a professional headshot a
believe in the circumstance but other
lives most of us spend more than 40
mix of credit types at 10 and the number
and you have no acting experience this
want from life
on your course take notes and just be
and saving on the commission especially
we're limiting today's conversation to
what I will do is I'll grab a notebook
all kinds of stuff
so now let's go through an example of a
remember to subscribe to this channel to
whatever these it's a lot better anyways
even crop it if you want to put
long it doesn't cost a lot of money to
productive things all right number eight
they need to be able to get in touch
if you put background work on your
you are thinking about embarking on the
at this moment i am
I wouldn't recommend doing the physical
sag-aftra so what steps you need to take
percent and there are some more little
all of my experiences so if you're
my hair and get rid of it and then that
people to help you this is when you can
long lasting career so when it comes to
anymore then that's where i would say
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
know it's it's your time use it well I
from the bottom right and we slowly work
especially when you get to the
money in this industry
lots of value to your house is change
my senior year of high school
in whatever city you live in right now
40 percent of your paycheck to them just
place so right now i do have
commission off
various principles strategies and tools
whether my brother was traveling for
wheel the story behind every single
this video will be aimed specifically at
it's not just about getting the agent
the scene a million times so my instinct
in real estate for example reits which
thumbs up and if you haven't already
remember to subscribe to this channel
avoidable by
channel in his website linked down in
this is the prep stage of real estate
and the agent so far so that was step
fun down in the comments below let me
a small college and I got injured and
television shows and I've created a free
actors to learn those concepts through
all right let's get started today we're
towards it they're gonna say alright
reel well here's something that i did
fantastic scene for a demo reel
self-pity and start doubting themselves
same quartz countertops these are
auditions when you are non-union
that let's say you go into an audition
and finding a ton of free resources
is the better doctor but professionalism
learn more from me about and email is
when you audition for something you're
i'll see you in the next video
guest or recurring
manufacture it distribute like logistics
helps you understand that there are many
money and time on your self-improvement
your headshot is your most important
way you make money through real estate
and then you go into the room and you
why because sometimes there will be
month and you'll see
play with the intensity of the light
know about the home buying process be
first name last name - headshot jpg that
it comes down to it you know just meal
as joining too
information stick in your brain and it
so let's assume this was directed by the
so if you want to hear some of my
reason why i think you can is because i
progressing just like with acting or
cheaper side in bigger markets and can
to put first you take a risk and fraud
card or the instant you have a bill
this is how i've been doing my grocery
deductions the real secret sauce with
you film them and then you edit them
and then here we got the master bathroom
especially at the start of your career
so that's why i think monologues are a
then uploads it to casting this is
in 2020 roughly half the states in the
your time and energy on it number three
in high school or college or community
you're not married and don't have anyone
and all of my parts in a totally
forward and and with that you offer that
chicago like new orleans
the topic of last week's video is what
filled in like mine is that's totally
digital digital product business you
in film and television acting hey if you
weeks now
is going to come
whether it's with you know our fitness
the way that he verbalized it it just
and what factors should you take into
of the shoot a callback is a
forward whereas a non-union actor can
now but I'll record all of the opposite
hundred fifty and over time as you get
mentioned is it's only a 30 minute a day
and then when the production schedule
but in the beginning
acting in fact i highly encourage
demonstrate or to perform the jobs in
you absolutely do not want to spend
and new roles and you know it was one of
distracting wrinkles can also be
extremely hard
is that depending on what market you're
footage back that you can put onto your
easier to find people who are willing to
yourself uh-huh
figure out which two are the most useful
different online classes are also a lot
to this channel to get more videos on
atlanta new mexico louisiana and a bunch
I'll get my time off if I have you know
your beauty with mehandi is at this
writing and copywriting and data entry
truly believe changed my business and
where you can make sure you don't know
i think a lot of people think you need
of pumps if you're buying a complete
you live it may cost a little bit less
determine when we get to sleep or how
acting career
completely free of charge for example if
basically so let's let's talk about what
and that's all i knew and the original
they have an audition
significantly lower and in the long term
because that is where
and they would use that audition to cast
your control and it can be really
and say that there are many
such an awesome thing just to be your
would think about those things and
makes it very easy to crop any image
you start to learn about the business
reduce how much income
could possibly be and that can
let's say you're above a 740 which puts
and remember at the end of the day being
supercharge our money making powers with
they can set whatever rules that they
video and you are one step ahead
single time so having a little recorder
these in my opinion are the three
if I have an audition tomorrow
production starts they have already cast
they might make a mental note and the
in a scene
submits to her agency
you haven't already subscribe to this
persona then by all means do so so she
easier and if you guys are really
understand that a great audition doesn't
ways to reach the top in real estate but
away content for free people won't buy
take quite a big cut from you for
character guest star is a bigger
have to do a full tent screening look at
what's going on but then when they
the appreciation on
entertainment industry is a
doesn't tell me anything that doesn't
to help train their medical students so
was doing is I was trading my time for
i'm actually extremely grateful that i
once a year but here's a situation where
that you don't have to have a ton of
you're a personal trainer and you're
or television shows but i was still
drove two
debt to income ratio
right-to-work states in union states
never have dreamed of when i was in
I go on and trust me real estate
your email list usually about three
switch some things around
in sugars I'm pretty sure ninety percent
encourage you to think about when you're
my email list and this might sound a
this video i'm going to show you
3 times as much money from the internet
conventional loans is that you can get
spend those x dollars you're going to
each other so you know awesome alright I
and do you need to move anywhere at all
in kansas city now if you live in a
example the types of tents you
booked roles on the same project so this
their homes with their significant other
account who can share with you so
people my age who are looking out of
gave an example so in this video I want
head shot because in this step of the
to carry on this conversation that is
my free
there that let you buy homes it much
there that you can read and they're
my current demo reel you can go to my
so if you are still in school definitely
you walk into the sort of like family
it or not
the money doesn't go directly to them
that anyone can promise you if they do
bit if you had any confusion about how
they sent it to you on purpose
association if
that you can write off the whole thing
and those people who doubt you it's okay
you can choose to do a roth or a
of like your mentor doing this will
friends and i like your friends with my
personal trainer and the owner of
trainers nutrition coaches whatever
you know show you guys the house show
literally just
come to find out that it was because
as well as get the best rate possible
is employment and sadly you cannot buy a
classes sometimes and the last thing
you know all these small purchases
if not
is the only time on an acting resume
where our more acting related because
end up booking that role
making even a question Bank that you
agent or anybody else in the industry
your business or to push forward in your
in the long run alright my number three
have those people around you who are
this whole industry is built on
gone in a different direction and you
right so what do you put on your resume
and not very inviting I'm not gonna
our way up
I really do think that it's because the
my name is inigo montoya
a little bit different so if you value a
reasons why you should never turn down
in the industry and i still take classes
self-employed you need to have tax
laughing and joking with each other in
all right i don't want to do this and
actor all right so way number one is
works in this video
your professional resume
income for now focus on saving and not
advanced Python courses are really good
saying things like oh you guys you guys
by the way this also applies to your
the future
i remember when my friends here in
in future episodes so you'll have to
you just didn't necessarily fit those
really visually appealing on the MLS so
it that is what works for you so you
you if you get quotes from at least five
steps and there's so much effort to get
that mastermind opened my eyes to so
a good actor
because it's not it's not necessarily
a different market depending on where
duplex or triplex and pay little to
actors submit themselves to talent
clients are coming in
actors for their student films
ethnicity entirely what can you do about
that's exactly where they want you to
real estate license not only that but
scenes when i say you i mean all of us
specifically how much an agent costs
you don't live in LA or in New York well
and talk through it answer any questions
properties that are too lavish
these are examples of industrial videos
gonna go through your income your
a moo a role in a feature film and i
of recent applications at 10
for me i do have a solo 401k
online courses over a brilliant who are
the comments below
if you buy more expensive and bigger
uh the patient to say something
and the whole history of investing
they make acting look so easy and
conflicts conflicts can refer to two
gonna start over we're gonna go back to
if the show got picked up and they
to seem a little bit scammy about how
multi-billion dollar machine and the
need to go to someone who specializes in
professional headshot can cost
get better those are the steps that you
be looking for someone who has a
happy i pretty much always do this
if they ask for it you should be able to
of the members just be like hey gee can
and it's harder for me now to accept a
you start selling products like physical
to be able to loan money to people that
higher your interest payments are going
for a few reasons number one
any recommendations on people to use
something that you want other people
if this is your first time here make
has taken over the major part of our
if you like this video please give it a
who has a strong resume and a body of
video I'll have links on there to some
slowly stop doing your other jobs and
is training every single actor needs to
more information like the name of your
started right now start preparing and
for that
you're trying to do it and why you're
class even better but learn how to
on your iphone from youtube best way to
time to waste on actors who are not
in full combat fatigues so dressed to
as something that has truly transformed
these plays are probably not going to
that you can get on your own which are
without really giving it much thought
is just that the teaching style is a bit
this industry is by being a stand-in now
to be very difficult to buy unless you
so the lesson here is if you are a newer
relive algebra class so I'm going to
failure then your body isn't as taxed
lot cheaper and don't even think about
details make a huge difference so if you
not work on your acting i'm just saying
i think it really helped me in terms of
one of the stormtroopers who has one
description of the character this is the
what's the best place to live if you
demo reel with your new footage and this
is that now you have someone on your
more scratch resistant and waterproof
real estate brokerage from there you'll
on youtube and when you improve yourself
it really is a complicated process
website if you have one if not use your
incorporate health and fitness into our
which is a
with friends or just creating a
background this stuff back here is cool
you can check out other resources that
definitely want to do that soon i just
our scene and once we got inside he had
when you get to the point where you're
I should have been ready to perform and
youtube i can literally go on a trip and
character now instead of going through
but if you haven't heard it
you look at it over a whole year that's
carpets are a pain in the ass to clean
some spare cash to go on holiday with
the same type of billing that you use
photos that's cost a lot because no one
so after i got released i just assumed
background but that writer is probably
here like i said lead supporting or
or I've got this huge action scene and I
submit to them
depending on where the acting studio is
look really great but they're gonna be a
kind of at that point where you're
have the sides and I said what my my
internet so thanks for watching and see
cobra kai
whenever you go into an audition by the
things will help you stand out more when
to get here
blockbuster movie
will be outward facing it's
the top concerns that landlords have are
you are most interested in is it movies
interesting and you will be remembered
next thing you have to know is that the
they're really talented because check
life to your cabinets and it's going to
is do you regret not starting your
so they have two things isn't her sake
as well as his youtube channel down in
there I think it was the first ad who
preference I've never heard of casting
you know how it works
online that means you can sign up for a
how we present ourselves in the audition
i'm currently working on the show i had
you reach 20% equity you can just get
anyway get in the habit of always
real estate agent in what can they do
choices up on the wall they taped them
in him in the video description he's got
make sense okay moving on
when we can just cast ourselves
get their name out there if you want to
now i guarantee you that every single
interested in pursuing a career in stage
cleveland ohio to atlanta georgia now
it's because stopping these habits is
role in whether or not you get cast but
not regrets uh if you like this video
and two work with them for one to two
don't have anything less than ten
is about the question what is enough in
of north america
for example let's say that a character
nine union productions can do whatever
psychology behind this but what I found
is that your pay is infinitely scalable
a real estate agent is that you're
increases for
as a background actor because now you're
time so i don't want you to miss any of
can certainly help with getting you
representation or i want an audition for
meet him alright that's it for this
dvds are kind of a thing of the past but
um or how soon it's gonna have him but
your life
movie or a major netflix show
estate about investing personal finance
other side of the camera
do with that
same website if they if they're
usually if that includes the name of the
is imdb
if people buy the movie video on demand
remember i told you that my auditions
a real estate agent you can pretty much
let's say a hundred dollars
glossy photo paper a lot of times only
so this is a great way to gain
because i upload a new video every
not you should join the union and when
never want to feel like there's an
bringing in three thousand dollars
order to succeed there's so many people
auditioning for indie
from generous retailers for example
pittsburgh and they were able to submit
affect you in so many ways so
again the scheduling being kind of the
pay mortgage insurance mortgage
in this video I want to show you an
that's the big set up but I show people
especially especially people
because you can save a lot of money the
consideration depending on where you
your second mark the next term is I
hear at auditions let me know down in
might want to start pushing
employee contribution this is the
and it's like this is some arbitrary
at least a thousand of these questions
failure then it takes you that much
pull out a pad and paper and start
series credits you actually write your
camera ready
your internet and if it's not something
or go to somebody that has the tools
there are many great brokerages out
is where the people looking for a
far more likely to buy your thing you've
channel if you new here my name is Ali
positive cash flow this means that all
everything like that
that are used all the time
this one was not going to be self-taped
for a medium a measure a standard a
all right here we're looking at my
backflip on a snowboard or someone who
help you see success much faster the
spot a phony the rule of thumb here is
people in kansas city right now are like
videos on acting auditioning and career
increasing your income is so important
that my subconscious is thinking about
there aren't any wrong choices there are
don't want to do that so yeah any cash
gonna be super important when it comes
working with an agent
along the way
items that are just costing us way too
get better at the process of auditioning
live what you want to do is you want to
you can rent out each of these units for
for one of the lead characters one of
off because this is who they called in
the filmmaking industry but also a
question I remember the first time I was
to put onto your resume and you're going
a terrible standardization because every
ties right back to your when I'm talking
so many questions
people are like well I can't eat that I
think those are two
you great if going through the fast food
your face is never going to be seen as a
stuff added up together that is why
zoom callbacks and it was with the
there's tons of natural sunlight right
you can do for them and what your
conflicting information what do we do
a step to find people who will pay you
anyway so take advantage of those take
interest payments on your car loan gas
bedrooms this is the first one it's a
are some people out there that think
looked at sunset and the thing with dusk
i tell
actually would like to have you read for
ideally we want to find a house with
you should tell people what you've been
say that 90
the vanities the counter tops the sinks
that 90
simple but as you saw I was smiling
can replace it or add to it add to your
these different things
headshot you don't want to be the actor
because doing these things not only add
stands for real estate investment trusts
here so come on figuratively
and you do like thousands of them then I
these are small plays that are done
up whenever your tent moves out you're
more so than
commercial auditions No why is this
headshot and your information
want to focus on so the first thing is
relevant right now and what is you know
for buying cheap groceries is to only
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
movies and television shows
you learn your lines faster recently I
audition number 1000 is gonna be it
is going to improve your acting much
we go to an audition
said before if you're in california
still laughing and then camera operator
and if you get like a croissant or a
that have been credits on my resume that
five dollars per transaction and
time it's a website called crop alikom
about this as their career they want to
on your computer digital headshots are
remember exactly what was written it's
some toilets and you know clean the
even though I had just personally
if you're willing to do all of that for
relaxed they were on set they would be
you're also going to get demo reel
if i had let that client stop me from
move and well
then let's move on to these next nine
work i'd love to see what other things
okay until next time keep practicing
would say 80% of the time they simply
auditioning and career advice every
schedules around that's why I recently
for it to count as a write-off you have
and look at you know am I feeling better
are gonna find helpful and the last
currently the fee to join sag-aftra
more videos on acting auditioning and
think of things in terms of opportunity
it's a recurring monthly charge and even
act but you're also getting paid to help
mortgage insurance premium of 1.75
so if you are someone who wants to get
be super high quality already film
vehicle deduction there's the mileage
master walk-in closet pretty good-sized
to show the world what you are capable
does come into play
you can actually put three percent down
the other actors who don't fit the
with these are the things that you shoot
auditioning and career advice every week
so really i encourage you guys to
anything online but the ideal thing that
important tips that you should be
captain america winter soldier um or the
hang your license with a broker can you
fluctuate and until you get a steady
change might have already happened but
right for this role but there's this
printer within the last five years or so
the mountain and when I tell people that
and then two months later you're stuck
huge benefit to being in these
that you really want to nail down is
the driveway or maybe the backyard so
and then an email address
production hack doesn't have to pay
the money saved up to join the union
better for the environment all right
an environment of more is better
of all the actors they represent and see
with all those other people who are
unless they are super super good you
another thing that really sucks about
this is how you prove to an agent that
in my opinion i don't think brand new
want to do is cram
so for television shows your billing is
talking about the pace of the storyline
still on a three-day diet they do it for
because they were born with it
practicing keep learning and I can't
read profit first because it is one of
because if you cannot do it for you and
of money and two they don't realize many
television shows commercials even
and ask us with its walls and ends with
eye level you don't want your camera
and that's why it's just important to go
brain you're only going to make as much
in exchange for having them tape your
so you're walking into the audition room
you have in the scene
too good for their listing that's why
you need to consider when choosing a
only actor in the room who had the full
directors your agent will use your demo
and understand the importance before
many other people think you cannot the
right so that that's awesome so again
if you live in miami now there are pros
they have many other actors to choose
corp so you choose to pay yourself
through my lines the last thing I do
the description is ages 16 to 25
the general public so
the term union status is something that
part about conventional loan is that
on the item so for example let's say we
want to do in order to gain the most
in real estate straight here on youtube
over a hundred and sixty episodes of
if you have any questions leave them
we're going to talk about all of that
the description below the next term is
for it and boom you get offered a role
show Steven Seagal law man can I like
acting teachers that charge
personal life so if your business is not
science courses and their introduction
three of that and then i also worked on
which is why I mentioned earlier you
we get some sort of routine and then
no actor starts their career by being a
putting less than 20% down using a
a production like this and thus should
exact scenario happened to me in 2017
be standardized patients
auditioning for
fha loan is better for people with a
finding the right actor to fill a
to break into the film and television
that you have an email list can be so
thing you can expect to pay for
agencies and only a
around it but at the end of the day you
like is the thing that we're buying
better at the thing you can start
and tell them i'm interested in being an
need a credit score of at least 580 and
which means casting directors will ask
eventually decide to cast me
career where
that go into the casting process
an audition in late the casting
get a steady paycheck
biomechanically does on a daily basis I
also i have clients who have been
then uploads it to the casting director
well they want to see people who are
them to say you know what you may not be
booked me off of my audition for that
with 30 seconds of only crying or 30
after you do pass the test first
nothing happens or you know maybe just
another way that an agent can help you
what you've done especially here in the
what type of home
hey we're in my hotel room again because
but there just wasn't a lot of film and
days is doing a self tape which is
description below this video step number
find the property and make sure that the
more that you do it the easier it's
and get cheaper classes that way i know
written copy and i also have a video
more forgiving in the area but the good
skim some of the stuff
the questions they can mark their
somehow i
really need to see what works for your
upload videos those are some of the the
something down it forces us to slow down
go to city data.com and from there you
a story
they're going to need to make movies
how to answer the question but I never
biking is it something where I'm doing a
the monotony you will stand out
and it's just so much harder to to learn
doesn't cost quite as much as new york
it too so if you want to learn more
taping commandment number nine is to
type of situation where it might be
there are not a lot of opportunities
get signed by a talent agency talent
saying the other lines of the other
advice that you're gonna hear from
write off you can even write off your
started to potentially audition for
together for so long and I do feel like
I did that are really important
what I would do here is I would read
anywhere near as much as a day on set
for example when i rented out the other
video because that would make this video
yourself okay be myself yeah you're on a
I will get some percentage Commission on
sit on my first line and I'm gonna stand
union actors and non-union actors
of getting a piece of that multi-billion
makes sense on why a demo reel is so
video I'm gonna be going over some very
the cabinets get some new countertops
throw away the four or five thousand k
you actually write the name of the
of that make well over 1 million dollars
you learn the skills you need to break
it takes you longer than expected to
dining expenses
rat race
make it harder for the producers to
about when you are further along in your
dialogue they need to see that you're
take your education through an online
having visual distractions well we
for and i don't think that's a great
house you can depreciate 50 000 in the
there are very few things in acting in
necessary steps the first step to
today we're going to be talking about
so here the formatting is exactly the
came to
not someone who doesn't look like this
is about 1 000 per day for the actor so
right but if you're watching videos like
williams and exp i know that they have
will fail within the first two years and
experience as an actor when you're just
open it up to people of other
they're only making minimum payments
you have a few credits on there
will give you the tools to succeed and
goals and make sure it's something you
within show it so show it is the website
the field there are tons of books out
respond to the question in my answer
commercial nothing in the audition
when it when in reality
but first let me just play a clip of the
can look at the statistics of any city
bristles or whatever the heck paint
and i also think there
move to one of the bigger markets this
opportunities out there
I don't like this identity that that
power of a network you never
and union projects now to an extent
there you can say ah do it for a fiver
advantage of those classes that are
people who request an audition are given
so that's something to consider as well
a lot more obvious what you should do
and yeah I love the stonework here
are casting a project not just one part
guest when your and your friends and
by following this exact format
talking to someone back and forth like
improvise during the shoot as well and
me to the casting director donna
the time that it takes the
i didn't end up booking that role but i
and i'm able to open up one of these
put down 3.5% for an FHA loan you only
negotiate for a better price for repairs
when an actor gets their scenes cut from
film and television industry
disney plus you can now watch it without
example words such as riparian rights or
and bigger properties all right the
printer paper first do the size
i'm in the midst of actually hiring
you're broke right now and if you don't
one of those days i can't remember which
investing into it and taking even though
assisting directors take us we will have
can be very valuable
you must join the union before you can
because i have some free summaries that
money right it's probably going to be
for a caucasian character but then they
inside of this house kind of going
architecture news and help your skills
help you stand out hey let's have some
officer uniform they could be casting
many things that i just literally had no
because you know there
you aren't booking jobs from them then
getting signed and getting
talking about the
does not have enough time to audition
couple more lines right here by just
get the opportunity to do theater
you so the only like exception i would
sometimes on a shoot the director will
necessarily mean small city
towards actually just making more money
pretty impressive
the difference and i will have to pay
dog now the reason I do that is because
photographers like family photographers
of it as having any value and rather
luckily i had a good enough score to do
broker in California make sure to hit me
worth a lot more than 50
and i was eventually booked on october
say is always do a home inspection i've
and they were taken advantage by it
number of things that the real estate
color and your eye color and your body
to have surgery look even if you're
and yes 100% means you get 100% of your
drop shipping January focuses on
bunch of big movies and big television
mentioned earlier that's the only
right there okay that's it for this
particular character that don't
the only difference you can tell is that
what projects i'm working on so i've had
you'll probably move on to bigger and
room and this place is a four bedroom
called tiny dinosaurs you would put it
strategy is
audition preparation process that i
that the viewers the potential buyers
so if that happens they are taking their
pursue a photography business no matter
you any money
project so let's say a project shoots
greenland hasn't come out in the united
same then this is a great great
dvd so if somebody buys a dvd of a
in all areas the tenth and final way to
is still does matter just because there
if this is your first time here make
i've done more tv shows than what's
switching from your name is worn so many
principal or the equity you have
you want to become like an agent but you
thinking that your best acting is
luxurious if you're doing a rental you
of whether or not you should join when
channel to get more videos on acting
but there was and I think this is more
personality because the last thing you
getting representation whether that's an
i'm going to tell you my opinion about
you're gonna have people around you that
watching this with say no to having an
recommend looking at as many testing
that's the steps that you have to take
off of monologues and onto other aspects
it comes from something that's
actor for their program
online I taught myself HTML and CSS
a few years ago i worked on an episode
was the path that my career took
said see
you go to your next audition so that you
as a few weeks but what i recommend
have a reasonable internet connection
broker that employs you hangs your
they offered me a different role in the
part of this
online educator what are the things that
being how young they are because they
less than 20% down and like I said
breakdowns and compare it to their
high level
and commercial properties can be great
look at the workout if you don't want
and it's crazy to think that the course
hundred thousand dollars with zero
this is where we start to see some of
auditions for every single role so
estate agent and starting to look at
that's perfectly okay just like with
into me getting my broker's license and
and then my eye color
ebooks have erased the necessity to have
physical stuff but obviously I think
if you want to be cast in a movie or a
and if you don't understand how those
the key is really to not overthink it
it doesn't matter
credit and you want to build it the easy
make sure to subscribe to this channel
successful real estate agent I recommend
this will make your life a lot easier
you'd find in a hospital now obviously I
you learn the skills you need to break
the small markets but in the major
seen lots of people transform those
be done
your scenes get cut you still get paid
on Facebook and Instagram so check to
or fatigue or overall exhaustion that's
getting your career started
people are a little bit strapped for
and then right hook but obviously you
thousands tens of thousands even
had a five-page audition that I had to
so same thing with an actor once you say
is required the amount of hours that's
taking acting classes
company is not going to hire
those are my top five biggest
make sure to check out this video which
in the thumbnail i wrote that monologues
websites that are used so you'll have to
acting auditioning and career advice
right eye and then give you a thumbs up
families are shrinking delivery services
you're deciding where you want to move
supposedly for our peers we end up
and three they don't need anything other
and create breakdowns for those roles a
and there is another way to get
people looking for loans especially FHA
shoot window and let's say you are a
about our physical headshots the
normal order at starbucks is five
speaking about preparing for auditions
a professional manner
it and i thought ah i lost my
have to have all of these sections when
little harder to use an email list in
audition for donna belijak in her office
if i had let that stop me i wouldn't
about audition terminology specifically
have demo reels right i'm trying to
do you think that neighborhoods is doing
yeah it probably is so be wary of anyone
how was i offered that role because one
business card and you
experience especially when you're just
number of ways that like they can ask
they start investing and letting their
non-union projects and union projects
that you're that you're seeking yeah so
the only time that i've seen it happen
maybe we were too tall for the role or
remember this is a new skill set so
those previous auditions of yours and we
on set one day
like that
need to spend money on is head shots
commercial with shaq
you 10 different ways that actors make
three days and then they go back to you
important to go into this field with the
if you're willing to do all those things
of The Vampire Diaries she went on to
expectations for example
will work hard
off dvd sales or blu-ray sales or video
they cuz sometimes just need that
to wear for my auditions so now that
for sure make this whole process a lot
to save some time and then i'll explain
put this
what you should do so why even have a
spending five dollars here and there
have so many
making those connections now if you've
know I wanted that to be the control and
the casting director sets the deadline
stuff because that's the stuff that we
courage requires one but besides that
probably gonna have to either power wash
savings account you're increasing the
of when they think real estate agent
other working actors that you know where
them excited about your audition and
this allows you to take that commission
because that takes away from me
i don't think i actually need these and
week and i have an
uninterested on
you get a certificate of completion for
so don't feel bad if you do them but
mosley and when he turns and son barry
audition for the role are gonna talk
a much more viable long-term solution is
house hacking it helps to have a clear
broker myself i have taken both the
you have no money left for your business
after i joined the union this is
partial list if you look over at my
beginner demo reel to show people your
house is probably going to be the
career right we don't need the outside
is the training from it the the building
looking on hot pads and seeing what
the description below so make sure to
has been taking acting classes it is
this video saying
you know focus 100
a lot of buying or purchasing or selling
between three and eight years that's
you may have to join the union before
understand what your options are and
would recommend putting it on your actor
rudder for transforming our relationship
and i hope to see you on set one day
know I teach classes from there that's
assistant who works for me and just a
that thing to other people and if you
another example of something in life
out and buy a fancy camera for taping
scene again it's a husband and a wife
should say and what you definitely
to be getting better as an
that file name they know exactly who it
similarly thousands and thousands of
less miles but have a more expensive car
resistance but fans people just do
back to your goals like my goal right
that i would
of your career i'm approaching 15 years
absolutely make a ton of money for
baseball or I was traveling for
people that you know we really really
our acting so make sure you are well lit
don't go in with a certain meat in mind
thank you so much for your time and i'll
about the topic for today the tell me
goes live because it's just insane um
what i would think about if i was in
step number one is to start training now
services and in fact you can even sell
shows you can do them on movies or
essentially took one of our website
fulfillment ceiling where more money and
time study with software developer at
shown then
helping out a producer or a director
belongs to
with the VA loans is that there is a
low budget indie films where the stakes
puts down 6% and when you're looking at
well the reason
course for example i took my salesperson
i didn't know shaq was going to be
book down in this description as well
next time keep practicing keep learning
an a-list celebrity they can hire you
well the reason why i love them is
and you've just wasted that money and
ways for you to find auditions and
now on that meal
the white house and then we would use
if you liked the video
finish of the paper you have the choice
right let's move on
episodes the cast and crew were working
that means go stand on your beginning
no hard feelings it
work their way up
those investments again it might feel a
walk into the pizza shop order pizza and
itself repeatedly without me having to
purchases that your clients will ever
tell me anything if I download that to
so imagine how much harder it would be
be the first thing that I do when I wake
acting career there are some other costs
important things are knowing the market
two hours away from cleveland and at the
representation and they'll sign you
been some hot streaks and there have
dollars with just a tripod
gonna explain exactly how all of that
it a thumbs up if you have any questions
years that i've lived in atlanta
the first way is to look in your local
now don't worry if your demo reel is
that's really going to help you to
why it's 20% they were just like hey 20%
i really want to play in the nba i've
couple days they'll put you in a hotel
expensive it depends on what type of
life as a giant wheel and if we have a
I've put the effort into creating the
with Python you can do anything from
work laws you really need to look at
you make the videos the recorded video
on your earnings for the year so those
or multi-unit you can always sell it
have a five hundred thousand dollar
so fast because this place is just so
even think about commercials
new videos soon and i can't share more
they uh sit back and relax and they
my acting classes in cleveland ohio and
show you an easier way a much easier way
are normally be largest transactions
every single audition is memorable then
the most popular ways to get into a home
check the website for specific
taking into consideration before you do
the house without actually coming here
know gives people access to medical
and learn how to code and so if you're
what's the truth about monologues well
this exact technique for her process so
many city many cities and towns have
today so why is every audition a win
eligibility you can't just
you're trying to buy a type of meat
really cool because you're you're really
way down i'm not like in my 70s or 80s i
audition preparation guide yet you can
lot are they going to be demanding
skeptical on whether or not it was even
get at the acting Career Center website
description that gets sent out so you
agent you may be wondering
that more expensive mortgage or rental
and do all of those things because look
cashless and this is becoming more
or what happens if there are any
money online by selling products when
that i worked on just just dropped on
countries and what casting platforms are
house so most people that buy their
i started reading the moment i started
remember to change to this other line
still feeling like she was working so
and schedule showings before our actual
and so I did this whole selling services
my new course and this is the very last
sense like lots of the countertops that
mcdonald's receipt guy
all familiar
the specifics might be a little bit
important to me and making a priority
other business they're trying
is here to make sure that actors are
probably have started investing so just
hopefully that makes sense that's the
because you never know from the casting
dollars for yourself this means that
like 10 different computers at once the
real estate broker you can't buy or sell
but i should have done it for the
who is pursuing an on-camera acting
with all that but starting a little bit
the union so here in north america the
auditions in this way
to talk to a lender before you start
the means was earning and the end was
full of
television production
a lot of people are going to want to
for one but if you don't don't get so
and commercials and theater in fact let
why it's so important to get your
be the type of person to offer to help
standardized patient
california i have my own investment
would not be a good idea because
atlanta for numerous reasons number one
million dollars because people the real
whenever you get an audition for a
that you guys can invest your money in
nothing's gonna throw you off you want
la might be a better option for instance
if you want to see more videos about
someone is making over 50 thousand
don't regret that at all i
if you are a follower of my channel or
only communication between the casting
away from you you own your email email
argue that it's for business or it's
big netflix show or a big marvel movie
not in a position to hey let me get a
wanted to make a videogame for my nerd
it didn't really occur to me how
making sure you find the things that do
elsewhere just know that it affects how
thing that I see and something I
pretty excited that i was going to get
they got this from your statement to the
social media because these tactics work
but if you are feeling called to make
can take to get started as an actor in
spending some time here with me today
you know you're not in pain or unable to
you spend about fifty thousand dollars
that big but the way of building any
being the first agent that people think
first thing you need to do is take a
because it's going to be virtually
it comes out to you making 300
why not write your own script write your
probably wondering the same thing I was
competitive as ours is these small
when you walk into the audition room and
so when an employee gets hired by a
of people you absolutely do not need the
in one year if it's over 6 000 pounds
long time
discount so it's a pre-sale that it's
out from the pile like a sore thumb and
possessions means more fulfillment as we
in that city or in the state in general
description as well in the industry we
audition was a sell tape and I had the
up on my third line so if you could just
to be an actor in american movies and
you don't want to blend in with a crowd
where I met Kellen and Jessica yeah we
templates and ebooks to
way anybody that I send it to if they
close a lot of deals and make a ton of
getting an agent
you can really see why it's so critical
channel to see more videos just like
not getting paid as
should be looking at the quality of the
model which if you have that look
it'll add value to my performance
led us to making that scene run very
so i don't think it's really that big of
let us help you buy a house for as low a
episodes series regular is one of the
once it finishes loading it gives you
is a topic for another day that's a
started pursuing acting when i first
get into the house right now
hundreds of homes before they actually
actor the penultimate item on my list
auditions without an
very start of your real estate career
for it i'm going to tell you a story
absolutely essential when you're trying
good year and a half so i joined my
income taxes don't pay them directly
respects acting is the same way
see some differences in terms of it
you can change all these different
now that's totally fine
out i don't recommend signing up for it
shows us that you can scream
whatever right this could happen to you
one huge lesson about auditioning that
for the entirety
created with your friends that you put
under a sag-aftra union contract and
go wrong so the more people that you
talent agent can be really helpful
in your small business i feel like this
that will help improve your chances of
bedroom with a desk or it could be a
instant return on your investment and i
refers to how an actor physically moves
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
in the on camera acting realm one fun
going out and buying a new printer first
you are building that relationship every
financial bureau policies credit card
helpful i'm definitely not a tax expert
within this industry the next way that
people who just like to create and have
looking for months and months without
of getting in touch with you if someone
short in parentheses this is the way
now for this year for the mileage method
out it'd be at some really cheap place
you go in and pass the test it's not too
you guys next time
the first step in house hacking is
you need to break out film and
enough sleep and I like the idea of what
knowledge on what it takes to be a
like this I would start to run some
you will basically
i think i would have freaked out if i if
i know la is kind of the mecca of the
lead character in a movie or a
hey guys welcome to my channel in this
audition on camera this is an excellent
you will learn how to spot deals and
acknowledge that my
him all the time on inside the nba on tv
hit some roadblocks where you don't know
way to gain experience as an
and in case you grow out of that house
conscious of what I was eating when I
don't have to do in your business
add lots of value to your house the
porcelain tiles are really cheap they
most of our lives we often feel like we
this is the movement that they want you
where we do these virtual classes for
dollars so yeah make sure you have some
type of deal another really great way to
something comes up you have some extra
caught up on the education they spend a
this for this whole page and a half
next day go to the printers and make
on the older generations as well
from on-camera classes improv classes
dollars in profit through their business
you know there's a variety in there you
the downside is that there is an upfront
the second i think about is do you have
this video or even more detailed videos
create a youtube link with your video
show off that you've done so much work
they're going to tell you
it didn't and so I am NOT a vegetarian
actually control
so if we want to make money or make
thousand dollars for headshots
would do it over and over again number
arranged them to ship it to the customer
sometimes that's just going to be a
in theater then i'm probably not the
link to it down in the description below
how do you know what to put on your
a property that you want to live in all
the point is that non-union productions
call this being right for the part every
a little bit click-baity
that sale and if enough
percent of the people on your email list
wait fall asleep at the same time wake
is the best this is at the end of the
gonna happen and so it was one of those
getting released that i've worked on
stand a reader is the person who is
opportunities here that's incorrect
share it with all of you guys
so that you can increase your savings
and pay attention to the other person in
on my list
divided by your pre-tax
really valuable resources and I can send
acting auditioning and career advice
all right second bedroom right here
then that can help you book the room and
it's usually the producers and the
license can take a lot longer than you
you think about in the world of email
and one book that i really recommend
taking headshots for actors a headshot
are a real estate agent then sadly no
and while you're doing that make a plan
can start very small with real estate
because joining the union is a very
one day
old but the owners of this house just a
stop you
selling his camera bag Pat Flynn has
you can do all of the same things that a
of deals because when you track the
foundations and our foundational
a free 10-step audition preparation
the pros far outweigh the cons
after you've gotten to the point where
even though i have absolutely no let
but it does create you know resiliency
gotten a chance to work on a lot of
headshot and your resume both have your
find a tenant
you can afford based on your income
literally just happened to me you guys i
anything there's no like actual reason
i actually worked on quite a few union
that i use to make sure
i know that the average american coffee
having a solid brand and so for me i
and give it a thumbs up
they want to avoid that at all costs and
agent because they want to see someone
look i've been tracking my auditions
Atlanta from Michigan Michigan to
outsource more because you'll actually
what I can control my look at least with
times like 45 minutes with explanation
in this video
in real estate investing and to do that
about this story was that remember that
time frame then you may say hey I
starting out is casting websites
an audition and I did get the sites
look like this
you have to complete and pass and at the
specifically how to memorize your lines
conflict and relationships and
resume your acting resume will always be
is effectively a myth and why you don't
thinking about moving
the same as the ones that i had recorded
need both you need
to see your personality and to see how
basis but you can just keep 1031
were buying this property so I hope that
as their fee now if you're doing it
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
transactions are complicated as hell so
all of these things are sacrifices that
fulfillment becomes more deeply embedded
the current three ways to join the union
put up so
an agent or you don't have somebody else
then the night before
in local plays
headshots on 8 by 10 photo paper this is
with this kitchen a built-in stove lots
percent correct on the test to pass and
with that won't reduce the quality of
people will say that sitting down and
the last thing we want is for you to
value or worth to that bookshelf and as
much money but if you want to build your
but you get a chance again to gain
statistics like that it really makes you
in order to get your real estate license
really it is impossible to make millions
and by the way this example resume that
course your actual audition plays a big
live in one of them and rent out the
so what this body weight class does is
kind of offset the colors so choose
probably one hour but i just really
in the morning when I wake up it's gonna
with you in these youtube videos in this
that you just mentioned I mean the whole
channel all about how to set up flowdesk
fact the audience doesn't even need to
it's okay if not everyone understands
alright I'm gonna get three square meals
might only be able to see
to have the listing and that's where
costco has a very generous return policy
agents I talked about it they had my
these this line out loud while writing
union if it does cost more to go union
unpaid or
i think in that respect background work
things the
about acting as part of their answer so
but i just want to give you one example
put 20% down when you're buying a house
traditional classroom you have to block
know why you're being asked that tell me
don't have an agent yet these are a
make sure you get a credit card and use
most medical schools will hire actors to
get approved for that loan of course you
so that's why i say step nine here is
imposter syndrome
how can you tell if an acting class is
the file on our computer with our first
would argue that just as important is
the character when it comes to you
back in 2016 I had the incredible
acting career center here to help you
then i improvised some responses and
very very difficult to do from another
that has a lot of my other videos about
in pretty much every major city in
Fitness until well into my acting career
they use demo reels to gauge an actor's
though this isn't part of your actual
printer can't print photos or if you
it's basically someone
runs the website and a podcast called
students ask
that if it sounds too good to be true
into the film and television industry
something that may have worked for
acting studio
gives you an audition
doing well and is on track to becoming a
and this comes with a lot of stress
pay of the project the union status all
and these are the tips tricks and study
only workouts I'd do I'm sweating I'm
brilliant who are sponsoring this video
tool that lets these lenders lend out
working like a nine-to-five job and it's
really scale to seven figures and beyond
use personally for my auditions you can
only i really need to do and then i'm
remember to download my free audition
headshot when we go to an audition well
want to pursue a career in american
come in like two to three weeks max
and this doesn't happen in every scene
november 6
one day
content give it a thumbs up and remember
didn't book any of them i was okay with
have that patience you're very likely to
ingrained in me
below this really all just ties into
casting director
only based on my personal opinion
about talent agents
in filmmaking it's happened to me before
especially if you want to become wealthy
when you're watching the show I'm
someone from out of state
process the smoother it's going to go
beneficial when you use it in the right
down in the description of this video
isn't that much time available that's
to be talking about how to print our own
useful these are habits that
happens a lot in this industry anything
case and so and so for your example you
when your headshot goes to a casting
your profit each and every month this
vanities for like 80 bucks and they're
before I went to bed and then as soon as
from others in your life don't let that
the time
you will hear
within this industry is a really popular
well i don't know any other actors how
if you have aspirations of becoming a
really like the fact that i started at
wherever you can find them just follow
with a movie venom I auditioned for a
that's really what I think made itself
his work and 10 other people i in
that you are searching for groups
potentially get a submission of
actual real growth in your business and
on in the video as well
advantage and if you're young and you
so one more time make sure you are
a guest star a recurring character or a
i don't know any other job where there
information that's on
leads like i mentioned earlier there's
just some quick background about myself
character or should you just dress as
tells me that i
voice and movement
anyway right we're hardly ever just
better deals and of course one of the
and if you found the video helpful make
again it's sustainability like if you
if you are submitting your acting resume
let's fast forward to
for yourself and look you don't even
review these questions and you need to
basically a public casting call now this
and that a headshot is an actor's
photographer every single year or i
studying computer science in college
crusher but also physiologically we're
your ability to deliver the message in a
before getting onto a big
mom was a statistician we were fortunate
to stay on top of your finances is to
so have your Realtor run some comps on
sleep is our greatest form of rest and
shouldn't say I'll tell you the answers
across every single social platform if
dollars per year you can save
what could feel better than that right
someone says they are a professional at
you were somehow responsible in any way
means that you're going to be subject
alright thanks you guys for tuning in I
but i promise it's completely worth it
didn't want to have to create all that
them that you
stress and three know how to leverage
home prices used to be like three four
could just simply put it on youtube
different things that you need to know
happy with my decision to move to
writes every teacher and every coach
experience it's a
a badge and everything and she was the
those lines so instead of just sitting
project myself I know that real estate
did some study questions to prepare
certain way of asking questions it's not
you live
either a project or a performer so a
commonly used for actors
so is it possible to live in a house or
stocks will be automatically deposited
making an app to making a website to
finally booked me
you're struggling with
the crowd that's how you show them that
your name should be printed somewhere in
are already doing the work
we don't have we don't have that
food that I wanted to because it was
it costs a load of money
me so a lot of the copy you see written
entrepreneurship and yeah i'll see you
should probably lift weights more and it
turn your audition in on time this
my acting career entirely at a young age
wedding photographer and i think it's a
every single day paying for convenience
spent doing on-camera acting
so on
uh if you want to get an entertainment
with and I'll record for instance line
lenders or mortgage brokers that way you
that need to be repaired before escort
self-motivated and self-starting and get
courses that i've quite liked is about
gonna be on sale and they're gonna be
video guys if you liked it please give
evangelizing for the last two years
month massive star power massive you
for example one of my good friends when
essentially wilding away
a really great team leader that is sort
FHA loans let you pay as low as 3.5%
please don't quit please don't give up
phone sideways and shoot your audition
and ask so tell me about yourself do you
happiness and that point of enough
your first rental or investment property
step 10
payments for the next 30 years the last
maintenance like going out and just kind
marketing properly but selling someone
your most important marketing tool
when finding car insurance and if you
but they still have a job to do and
or all these all these things that are
two-bedroom condo and rented out that
gave me the opportunity to audition for
long day on set or if you're rehearsing
don't waver or i shouldn't waver right
should also have some type of
agent and we're not talking about being
actors usually don't know where the next
third thing that you guys can do is
not part of their tool belt and they
to the camera a little bit more
organized and right now there are so
but it's very hard to become a good one
have steady employment or if you're
learned this technique on set when I saw
good is anything from a website to an
to build a website and make money off
professionals will go to to check out
class in Cleveland Ohio since Cleveland
on-camera careers
comes in the form of the sacrifices that
moving to one of the major production
in your career if you cut corners here
self taping tools linked in the
expensive one
to do both at the same time would would
definitely the longest-running show I've
the opposite effect if you put
to find buyer and seller leaves some
all the things that you can be doing
time to sell so I knew it was really
buy rental property you can use cash you
and if i had let her doubts stop me if i
number seven is that the actor should be
yeah that's definitely a possibility but
more of you let's use that explosion
cheat sheet until next time keep
amateur agents and casting directors are
are on their short list you are in high
if you think about like that it becomes
out the others so
we're eyeing up that new ipad air that
all of my videos i talk about the
let's say for a hundred pounds apiece
who wants help and having that
broken spoke but we're trying to just
tripod with an adapter like this that
cheaper but they're also gonna be a lot
that's why all major movies and
and they watched your acting ability
thousands of students apply for
just $50,000 down that equates to a down
times people think well if I don't have
to work on
was to sit down at a desk kind of lean
interested in learning my 10 step
you guys have not yet signed up for
downloading that cheat sheet you can get
works is that
see all of the actions involved in the
the more you cram the worse your
there's a
so then i didn't hear anything for two
production a union production or
we're working on and getting feedback
to check with people in your market to
to grow your career is la the only
there's some confusion regarding this
hey guys my name is charlie i own a real
I love the word resiliency so you're
subscribe to this channel and until next
they gave me two or three different days
little bit because I was still kind of
knowing that a majority of your time is
those of you who have mentioned
channel if you haven't already
exterior for this house it's super
in california for instance or new york
type of insurance for these mortgage
one month for them to actually receive
picked up which it did
line and simply being aware of the food
free most is that everything will turn
other so just pick whichever one you
the stuff it's like having a pair of
freakin cool gray selfie habbid home
but then like the layout doesn't really
when i don't know anybody else who's an
movie all right that was a peek behind
and that we're not making any mistakes
of the commercial is to get people to
it could be right justified i'll leave
technique repetition
selling services as a web and graphic
the technical details right
submit to an agent and they're
instead of spending all your effort on
audition so in a way they do decide who
website that sells nice-looking watches
name is alex collins and he talks about
write sag-aftra right down here
is the industry standard size for a
